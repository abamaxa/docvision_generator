 examiners should also be prepared to award zero marks if the response is not worthy of credit according to the mark scheme
 where some judgement is required mark schemes will provide the principles by which marks will be awarded and exemplification may be limited
 when examiners are in doubt regarding the application of the mark scheme to a response the team leader must be consulted
 history marking guidance marking of levels of response the mark scheme provides an indication of the sorts of answer that might be found at different levels
 it is intended as a guide and it will be necessary therefore for examiners to use their professional judgement in deciding both at which level a question has been answered and how effectively points have been sustained
 candidates should always be rewarded according to the quality of thought expressed in their answer and not solely according to the amount of knowledge conveyed
 however candidates with only a superficial knowledge will be unable to develop or sustain points sufficiently to move to higher levels
 at the end of each answer examiners should look back on the answer as a whole in the light of these general criteria in order to ensure that the total mark reflects their overall impression of the worth
 deciding on the mark point within a level the first stage is to decide the overall level and then whether the work represents high mid or low performance within the level
 one stronger passage at level would not by itself merit a level award but it would be evidence to support a high level award unless there were also substantial weaknesses in other areas
 assessing quality of written communication qowc will have a bearing if the qowc is inconsistent with the communication descriptor for the level in which the answer falls
 if for example a history response displays mid level criteria but fits the level qowc descriptors it will require a move down within the level
 generic level descriptors part as part of an historical enquiry analyse and evaluate a range of appropriate source material with discrimination
 sources are used as evidence with some consideration of their attributes such as the nature origins purpose or audience with some consideration of how this can affect the weight given to the evidence
 in addressing there is a clear attempt to use the sources in combination but this may be imbalanced in terms of the issues addressed or in terms of the use of the sources
 the attributes of the source are taken into account in order to establish what weight the content they will bear in relation to the specific enquiry
 analyse and evaluate in relation to the historical context how aspects of the past have been interpreted and represented in different ways
 these will be supported by limited factual material which has some accuracy and relevance although not directed analytically at the focus of the the material will be mostly generalised
 they may however include material which is either descriptive and thus only implicitly relevant to the focus or which strays from that focus
 candidates offer an analytical response which relates well to the focus of the question and which shows some understanding of the key issues contained in it
 there will be some integration of contextual knowledge with material drawn from sources although this may not be sustained throughout the response
 the candidate will demonstrate the skills needed to produce convincing extended writing but there may be passages which lack clarity or coherence
 comprehends the sources and selects from them in order to identify points which support or differ from the representation contained in the question
 when supporting the decision made in relation to the question the sources will be used in the form of a summary of their information
 in addressing the specific enquiry there is clear awareness that a representation is under discussion and there is evidence of reasoning from the evidence of both sources although there may be some lack of balance
 assessment grid question and b number marks or total marks weighting marks marks total marks for question note on descriptors relating to communication each level descriptor above concludes with a statement about written communication
 thus most candidates whose historical understanding related to a given question suggests that they should sit in a particular level will express that understanding in ways which broadly conform to the communication descriptor appropriate to that level
 indicators of written communication are best considered normatively and may be used to help decide a specific mark to be awarded within a level
 quality of written communication which fails to conform to the descriptor for the level will depress the award of marks by a within the level
 source reveals lee to be defending himself against accusations that he failed to support supremacy thus suggesting the visitations were more concerned with control
 in exploring the differing views candidates may highlight the attribution of sources reflecting on the roles of layton lee or indeed cromwell as well as the possible timing and nature of their correspondence
 candidates may highlight purpose in source and link this to reference to having been visited by him in source or examine desire to demonstrate both his loyalty and the difficulties he faced in administering religious matters
 in this sense whilst source does demonstrate some level of success it can be contrasted with source in that it highlights the limitations to attempts to gain success by military means
 alternative arguments may suggest henry was outmanoeuvred by ferdinand and maximilian perhaps using the treaty to demonstrate attempts to redeem this with his unfulfilled aim of a joint venture to drive ferdinand from navarre
 number indicative content mark the question asks candidates to assess the contribution made by cromwell in breaking with papal authority before taken as a set the sources offer evidence for and against the claim in the question
 both sources and offer evidence regarding contribution albeit in somewhat differing ways with source emphasising relations with henry as well as his abilities in drafting legislation and shaping ideas into practical policies
 source considers the significance of cranmer as another individual closely associated with henry whilst also referring to parliament and the issue of the divorce
 candidates can build on these arguments by reference to other factors such as actions and the influence that she was able to exert as well as the role of the named reformers in encouraging protestant beliefs to take root
 they may also consider issues such as the role of and the opportunity provided for henry to expand his power and enhance the role of the monarch at the expense of the church
 candidates are unlikely to address all of these issues in depth in the time available and the sources can be combined with own knowledge to reach high levels by a variety of routes
 crown parliament and authority in england question number indicative content mark candidates are asked to assess the extent to which evidence is offered to demonstrate elizabeth being well supported in her later years as queen
 evidence can be found in source to suggest elizabeth could command strong support in particular highlighting warmth of support towards elizabeth over a range of issues
 in contrast source highlights disquiet amongst the nobility particularly over diminished opportunities for office holding suggesting their circumstances have been reduced financially through this
 this feeling of dissatisfaction is extended further by source emphasis on the impact that subsidies have had on the gentry and lower orders and that this is breeding discontent and the safety
 candidates may also highlight the issue of religion perhaps linking catholicism to the reference to in source to explore the extent to which this shaped attitudes towards elizabeth
 source offers a less favourable assessment of rule in these years highlighting how his extravagance and failure to balance the interests of different groups created tension
 it may be argued that whilst james had firm views over the position of the monarch these did not necessarily sour relations in these years
 candidates are unlikely to address all of these issues in depth in the time available and the sources can be combined with own knowledge to reach high levels by a variety of routes
 whilst source does highlight differences over foreign policy greater emphasis is placed on difficulties after the accession of charles to the throne
 source can be seen to extend this to some extent with the commons explicitly decrying the growth of arminian and papist influences whilst also highlighting the disagreement over prerogative and the right to raise revenue
 candidates are unlikely to address all of these issues in depth in the time available and the sources can be combined with own knowledge to reach high levels by a variety of routes

 at level candidates are required to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding and their ability to sustain a critical line of argument in greater depth and over a wider range of content than at level
 select and demonstrate clearly relevant knowledge and understanding through the use of evidence examples and correct language and terminology appropriate to the course of study
 in order to ensure the marking scheme can be and consistently and to examiners to mark in a standardised it defines levels of response by which answers are assessed
 this ensures that comparable standards are applied across the various units as well as within the team of examiners marking a particular unit
 in candidates answer a single question but are reminded by a rubric of the need to address both objectives in their answers
 in the marking scheme each question is provided with a brief outline of the likely content lines of argument of a answer but this is by no means prescriptive or exhaustive
 mark scheme june examiners must not attempt to reward answers according to the extent to which they match the structure of the outline or mention the points it contains
 the specification is designed to allow teachers to approach the content of modules in a variety of ways from any of a number of perspectives and answers must be assessed in the light of this flexibility of approach
 it is quite possible for an excellent and valid answer to contain knowledge and arguments which do not appear in the each answer must be assessed on its own merits according to the levels of response
 synoptic skills and the ability to make these are now assessed at as specification due to the removal of the connections papers

 marks guidance question mark scheme june indicative content candidates might begin with an introduction explaining that the sunnah the sayings practices and customs of muhammad is the model the perfect example for muslims
 as regards status most candidates are likely to identify the sunnah as the second most important source of authority after the they might explain that the sunnah clarifies some e
 better responses are likely to develop the explanation to include ahadith and might give some historical account of the usul of authority in and explain that they are based on the and sunnah
 the four law schools might be mentioned malikite the hanafite of the and the candidates might explain that criteria were established to guarantee the authenticity of the hadith concerning the sunnah
 in assessing the extent to which there is unanimity candidates might comment that the majority of muslims regard six collections of hadith as being sound and that the most significant is that of al bukhari
 candidates are likely to take into consideration the fact that sunni muslims accept ahadith based on transmission from the four rightly guided khalifas whilst the muslims have authoritative sayings from imams who speak with special authority
 responses will probably include some information about the other three khalifahs and candidates are likely to try to select relevant material to address the question
 for example abu despite the ridda wars set the expansion in motion and sent an army to defeat the byzantine forces
 appointment of his cousin as governor of syria is likely to be mentioned because the opposition to ali as fourth khalifah led to problems which have reverberated through the centuries
 for islam the brief time that ali was khalifah was a golden age and candidates might refer to the influence of his virtues and knowledge as well as his writings in spreading islam
 discussions might include the views of scholars about other factors besides the efforts of particular khalifahs which contributed to the astonishing spread of muslim territory and influence over the first years
 before attempting to compare the contribution of individuals some candidates might point out that the title guided given by some muslims shows that to them the spread of islam was part of and due to the will of allah
 candidates have studied life and the roles of men and and surah as well as sunnah and law as bases for muslim candidates might therefore quote from the for example from surah e
 are the protectors and maintainers of women because allah has given the one more than the other and because they support them from their etc
 some candidates might demonstrate understanding that rules are derived from the and sunnah but where there is no clear teaching qiyas and ijtihad provide rulings on areas of uncertainty
 encompasses all aspects of life and some candidates might explain the code of modest dress conduct expected of both men and women
 others might differentiate between the treatment in muslim states and muslim countries of men and women with reference to punishment for behaviour such as adultery
 candidates might suggest laws that have and could help family life in a positive way especially when dealing with new problems and issues which arise for islam in a rapidly changing global world
 candidates might consider that islam like other faiths is facing the dilemma of looking back but also looking forward whilst trying to disentangle the essential truths and values of islam from traditional culture and customs

 examiners should also be prepared to award zero marks if the response is not worthy of credit according to the mark scheme
 where some judgement is required mark schemes will provide the principles by which marks will be awarded and exemplification may be limited
 when examiners are in doubt regarding the application of the mark scheme to a response the team leader must be consulted
 history marking guidance marking of levels of response the mark scheme provides an indication of the sorts of answer that might be found at different levels
 it is intended as a guide and it will be necessary therefore for examiners to use their professional judgement in deciding both at which level a question has been answered and how effectively points have been sustained
 candidates should always be rewarded according to the quality of thought expressed in their answer and not solely according to the amount of knowledge conveyed
 however candidates with only a superficial knowledge will be unable to develop or sustain points sufficiently to move to higher levels
 at the end of each answer examiners should look back on the answer as a whole in the light of these general criteria in order to ensure that the total mark reflects their overall impression of the worth
 deciding on the mark point within a level the first stage is to decide the overall level and then whether the work represents high mid or low performance within the level
 one stronger passage at level would not by itself merit a level award but it would be evidence to support a high level award unless there were also substantial weaknesses in other areas
 assessing quality of written communication qowc will have a bearing if the qowc is inconsistent with the communication descriptor for the level in which the answer falls
 if for example a history response displays mid level criteria but fits the level qowc descriptors it will require a move down within the level
 generic level descriptors part as part of an historical enquiry analyse and evaluate a range of appropriate source material with discrimination
 sources are used as evidence with some consideration of their attributes such as the nature origins purpose or audience with some consideration of how this can affect the weight given to the evidence
 in addressing there is a clear attempt to use the sources in combination but this may be imbalanced in terms of the issues addressed or in terms of the use of the sources
 the attributes of the source are taken into account in order to establish what weight the content they will bear in relation to the specific enquiry
 analyse and evaluate in relation to the historical context how aspects of the past have been interpreted and represented in different ways
 these will be supported by limited factual material which has some accuracy and relevance although not directed analytically at the focus of the the material will be mostly generalised
 they may however include material which is either descriptive and thus only implicitly relevant to the focus or which strays from that focus
 candidates offer an analytical response which relates well to the focus of the question and which shows some understanding of the key issues contained in it
 there will be some integration of contextual knowledge with material drawn from sources although this may not be sustained throughout the response
 the candidate will demonstrate the skills needed to produce convincing extended writing but there may be passages which lack clarity or coherence
 comprehends the sources and selects from them in order to identify points which support or differ from the representation contained in the question
 when supporting the decision made in relation to the question the sources will be used in the form of a summary of their information
 in addressing the specific enquiry there is clear awareness that a representation is under discussion and there is evidence of reasoning from the evidence of both sources although there may be some lack of balance
 assessment grid question and b number marks or total marks weighting marks marks total marks for question note on descriptors relating to communication each level descriptor above concludes with a statement about written communication
 thus most candidates whose historical understanding related to a given question suggests that they should sit in a particular level will express that understanding in ways which broadly conform to the communication descriptor appropriate to that level
 indicators of written communication are best considered normatively and may be used to help decide a specific mark to be awarded within a level
 quality of written communication which fails to conform to the descriptor for the level will depress the award of marks by a within the level
 in source lawson claims thatcher possessed while healey points to her capricious nature suggesting any conviction depended on her state of however there are many areas of reconciliation and many candidates are likely to identify these
 although both sources and see more that is good than bad in margaret thatcher they do nonetheless both contain many of the same criticisms that healey in source makes
 thus both recognise as does healey that thatcher became increasingly domineering in her later years as prime minister and alienated supporters
 both also agree with source on some of her negative character traits source and unbearably source source the more perceptive may also draw further similarities through closer textual reading
 those operating at the higher levels will be able to account for the differing assessments in the sources by an examination of the source attributions
 his fondness for mrs thatcher may the more perceptive will suggest be based on the fact that she was good for business
 the claim that the welfare state the most effective single against poverty can be used as a platform for an examination of the welfare reform introduced in this period
 from their own knowledge candidates may also explore such areas as housing education and food production agriculture act arguing that increases and improvements led to a substantial rise in the general standard of living
 those performing at higher levels will however use a closer reading of the text to present the thus it will be noted that pugh is referring to poverty not austerity
 the emphasis on in source and the daily depiction of hugh dalton should serve as a platform for the more knowledgeable to detail the austerity measures introduced from onwards
 candidates may refer to budgetary restraints to ensure that the focus of production was for the export market to the rationing of petrol and taxes on beer to develop the theme of austerity
 some candidates may argue that by the end of the period in question some relaxation had resulted in improved conditions with for example the board of trade under harold wilson gradually removing items from rationing
 the use of the word hints at the possibility of underlying successes and these are indicated in sources and both sources and note that callaghan was a steadying influence during turbulent times
 the more able may suggest that any praise coming from source a political rival of callaghan should be taken seriously
 they may refer to the new income brought in by north sea oil and the positive impact this had on the balance of payments
 those with greater contextual knowledge may also note political skill in negotiating a pact with the liberals during this period

 mass media popular culture and social change in britain since question number indicative content mark all three sources can be used to support the contention in the question
 both sources and disagree with the contention and that even cameron in source is prepared to qualify his concerns by accepting that some good comes from open communication networks
 both also argue that social media are not the cause of violence with fort extending her defence by pointing out the role played by networking sites in apprehending rioters
 in considering the provenance of sources and candidates may argue that both authors have a professional interest in defending social networking and that their opinions need to be treated with caution
 at the very highest levels all three sources will be placed in the context of the heightened public sensitivity that would inevitably follow such a spate of mass civil unrest
 from their own knowledge candidates should be able to use the sources as a platform to develop the arguments both for and against the contention in the question
 there should be an awareness shown of the general content of initial report on the iraq dossier and in particular his claim that the government knew that some of the information it contained was incorrect
 candidates should also be able to display an understanding of how the controversy subsequently unfolded with the initially defending and subsequently dismissing gilligan
 they may develop knowledge of the consequences of the exposure of source dr david kelly which resulted in appearance in front of a televised committee enquiry and later led to his suicide
 source notes the widespread press coverage the group enjoyed and evidence of this comes in from source article in the new statesmen not a journal one would normally expect to devote a great deal of attention to popular music

 dandolo diary may source swiss writer recalls the response of neapolitans to garibaldi four days after he entered naples on september he is quite admirable like a lion with a firm voice and strong physique

 mark schemes are prepared by the principal examiner and considered together with the relevant questions by a panel of subject teachers
 this mark scheme includes any amendments made at the standardisation meeting attended by all examiners and is the scheme which was used by them in this examination
 the standardisation meeting ensures that the mark scheme covers the responses to questions and that every examiner understands and applies it in the same correct way
 as preparation for the standardisation meeting each examiner analyses a number of alternative answers not already covered by the mark scheme are discussed at the meeting and legislated for
 if after this meeting examiners encounter unusual answers which have not been discussed at the meeting they are required to refer these to the principal examiner
 it must be stressed that a mark scheme is a working document in many cases further developed and expanded on the basis of reactions to a particular paper
 assumptions about future mark schemes on the basis of one document should be whilst the guiding principles of assessment remain constant details will change depending on the content of a particular examination paper
 the extra information is aligned to the appropriate answer in the part of the mark scheme and should only be applied to that item in the mark scheme
 in general the right hand side of the mark scheme is there to provide those extra details which confuse the main part of the mark scheme yet may be helpful in ensuring that marking is straightforward and consistent
 emboldening in a list of acceptable answers where more than one mark is available two is used with the number of marks emboldened

 for question the marking schemes which follow were those used by for the summer examination in they were finalised after detailed discussion at conferences by all the examiners involved in the assessment
 the conferences were held shortly after the papers were taken so that reference could be made to the full range of responses with photocopied scripts forming the basis of discussion
 the aim of the conferences was to ensure that the marking schemes were interpreted and applied in the same way by all examiners
 positive marking it should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit should be given for what the candidate writes rather than adopting the approach of penalising for any omissions
 marks should not be deducted for a less than perfect answer if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme nor should marks be added as a consolation where they are not merited
 some credit for candidates who show understanding of productivity and that it has fallen output more without a correct definition or correct calculation
 mark allocation assessment objective consumer surplus clearly defined between the price a consumer is willing to pay and the actual market or correctly identified on the diagram
 mark allocation assessment objective diagram showing a supply curve shifting to the left with a new higher price and lower quantity
 if no clear explanation of how market forces will push up the price of up to discuss whether an increase in the price of permits would be likely to cut carbon emissions
 yes it will cut polluting firms have an incentive to reduce pollution further so that they can make profits from selling the permits
 polluting firms have an incentive to reduce pollution further by becoming more in new technology to avoid buying the more expensive permits
 good developed data use required for marks focus on increase in emissions due to use of connecting flights or very well developed argument on tax more general reference mark
 point up to for possibly negative expectations prevent rises in and exports may not rise despite the fall in export prices
 both demand pull and cost push low consumer or business confidence will negatively affect a cut in interest rates
 lower corporation tax encourages business profits for training up to marks per time very long time before benefits are seen
 potential for government failure policy is ineffective training is inappropriate for the needs of the labour policies offer poor value for money in terms of easier for firms to recruit trained labour from abroad
 mark allocation assessment objective answer mark allocation assessment objective by how much will imports fall as a result of the from to accept answers without millions
 with reference to the diagram explain how domestic producers might benefit from the imposition of increase in producer use of more profits etc
 increase in domestic use of diagram more higher price of imports of diagram allows greater profits for domestic firms reduced imports use of mean higher domestic market share ltd
 positive marking it should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit should be given for what the candidate writes rather than adopting the approach of penalising for any omissions
 marks should not be deducted for a less than perfect answer if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme nor should marks be added as a consolation where they are not merited
 mark allocation assessment objective good understanding showing an awareness that fiscal policy involves the use of both government spending and tax
 use of explains that defence spending means that the government has less money available to spend on infrastructure there enough money to spend on both
 or candidate shows an understanding that opportunity cost means that the benefits from one option are lost because the other has been chosen
 fair explanation of why will be affected weak explanation of at least two of and the exchange rate or good explanation of one factor
 mark allocation assessment objective question using a diagram discuss the view that raising income tax rates for those individuals earning over will increase tax revenue for the government
 raising tax rates will not increase higher income tax rates may reduce entrepreneurialism make the less attractive for new businesses to be founded hence tax revenue might fall
 will fall because tax increases will cause consumption and possibly investment to fall again causing job losses and impacts along the supply chain
 linked back to recession using diagram shifts leftwards reducing the equilibrium level of real max if treat and separately
 cause a global recession to marks with a exports from other countries to the will fall reducing in those countries for which the is a major market reducing in those countries
 mark allocation assessment objective answer discuss whether less on defence and more on both improving crumbling infrastructure and boosting spending on education and will be enough to reduce the trade deficit
 yes it will reduce the deficit to improving infrastructure can improve the trade deficit encouraging inward domestic investment so that more products are made domestically instead of can be exported
 reducing defence spending can reduce the trade deficit by may reduce demand for imported components such as steel electronics and so on
 no it will not be enough to reduce the trade deficit to improvements in productivity may not be enough given competition from abroad
 max in total for any of the supply side policies take time to take effect so therefore the trade deficit may only begin to fall in the long fall in the short run
 other factors affect the trade deficit such as the exchange rate and if these are moving in an adverse direction the deficit may still not fall
 mark allocation assessment objective question answer explain why the equilibrium wage rate for some jobs is below the national minimum wage
 therefore supply will be high at any given wage rate because anybody can do low levels of formal qualifications are needed
 inward migration from the has increased supply more in some sectors than in others some of these are in low wage jobs
 to demand is relatively low including demand for some jobs is falling because workers are being replaced by technology checkout operators recession has caused falling demand for goods and services reducing the derived demand for labour
 because markets are highly are easily which prevents the equilibrium wage from being use of diagram or otherwise to explain why these will push down the equilibrium wage
 is too low to low minimum wage provides little incentive to look for work therefore restricting the supply of workers to firms
 minimum wage has not kept up with the cost of living in recent years therefore reducing living standards for the most vulnerable members of society
 only affects a relatively small number of workers hence it is not really doing the job that it was designed to do
 is not too low to minimum wage at this level reduces the demand for labour because costs are too high therefore causing job losses integrated diagram to illustrate increase in unemployment
 minimum wage drives up firms costs forcing firms to increase prices hence leading to an increase in inflation and damaging international competitiveness
 wage levels have attracted migrant workers from abroad hence the wage is clearly attractive within the european labour market so high enough
 however this depends to maybe too high in some areas and too low in others meaning that a regional minimum wage might be more sensible
 if demand is highly wage elastic then the impact on unemployment will be much greater this is quite likely when the economy is in slowly because firms are unable to afford the increase
 marks for a clear explanation of how prices and profits work to allocate resources in a free market possible suppose demand rises for a particular good
 as a result of this new producers will be encouraged into the market because the higher prices will encourage cover higher marginal costs
 prices to prices are important for bringing supply and demand into equilibrium if there is excess demand prices will rise causing a contraction in demand and extension in supply diagram
 up to free markets allocate resources efficiently the market for education and health will be in equilibrium at a price which ensures demand equals supply
 if education and health are supplied free they will be undervalued and overused hence creating excess demand waiting lists in hospitals etc
 therefore provision through the free market will lead to a misallocation of resources because will be resulting in a welfare loss welfare loss diagram
 market provision of health care allows providers to exploit asymmetry of information when treating health care is a basic therefore it is unfair to make people pay for it and inequalities will be driven max with no evaluation
 mark allocation assessment objective question explain why governments may need to intervene in the market for fish to prevent market failure
 mark allocation assessment objective question with reference to relevant economic theory evaluate the policies that could be used to preserve fish stocks in the north sea
 up to fish subsidies can be given to set up fish farms hence increasing the supply of fish but costly disease spreads quickly escapes from farms can affect the gene pool
 up to regulate fishing techniques outlawing certain techniques bottom regulations such as wider mesh nets reduces size and amount of fish caught but cost of policing due to the number of areas involved
 max for undeveloped policies award marks to best policies max for explanation of policies with no avoid evaluation of policing relevant diagram to support any piece of analysis above is worth up to ltd
 mark allocation assessment objective answer question explain why it may be difficult for a government to achieve all its macroeconomic objectives at the same time
 understanding of key macroeconomic employment low stable inflation economic growth current account balance accept also deficit reduction or sustainability reducing or reducing inequality etc
 rising unemployment may push the economy closer to full employment as a result resources begin to run is lower in product markets
 it may be difficult to achieve policy objectives but not impossible because ssps might work but these take a long time to implement etc
 rising taxes from rising higher income taxes may mean that the existing population will now have to pay more of their income
 but may create disincentives to work tax illustrated by laffer curve may reduce further reducing receipts and increasing unemployment therefore increasing benefit payments
 higher corporation tax in principle corporations will have to pay a higher proportion of their profits to the government therefore raising tax revenue and reducing the deficit
 but corporation tax is easy to avoid for some corporations may deter resulting in lower tax receipts in the longer term
 mark allocation assessment objective allocation answer question cutting government spending from cutting cutting capital spending cuts on major infrastructure projects will reduce outgoings meaning that the gap between and is smaller
 cutting current spending cuts in regular payments for public sector salaries and other running costs cut the outgoings reducing the gap between and current spending forms the majority of the outgoings
 cutting transfer payments social protection is a big area of government spending so cutting it will save money therefore reducing the gap between and may also create incentives to work helping to increase the tax base
 as a result tax base may rise via income tax and and government spending may fall as a result of reduced benefit but monetary stimulus may not be very effective because of liquidity trap and low confidence levels
 interest falling interest rates create a disincentive to to borrow also reduce mortgage repayments increasing discretionary income falling interest rates may cut incomes of savers reducing consumption
 availability of credit if banks have funds available then consumers will be unable to borrow developed with reference to current events in the confidence if confidence is low consumers may not wish to max for each explained point
 not so good for the if economy is close to capacity then inflation may rise because resources start to run short easier to increase prices etc
 depends how much consumption rises by if rises by no more than potential then problems are less rises by more than potential growth inflation is more max without evaluation max without a diagram
 mark allocation assessment objective question using a diagram show how a fall in the value of the pound might be caused by a widening trade deficit and explain how the weaker pound might improve the price competitiveness of firms
 exports are falling which will reduce the demand for on the forex as a result there is excess supply of sterling on the forex market at the original exchange rate
 because goods and services are cheaper in terms of foreign currency words to that rising import prices cause domestic goods to look more competitive relative to imports
 because the weaker pound means that it costs more to buy a given quantity of imports words to that prices are higher in sterling terms etc
 mark allocation assessment objective question discuss whether a sharp fall in the value of the pound will be beneficial for the economy
 lower export prices make destinations more price competitive thus raising and higher import prices reduce imports benefiting home producers in terms of etc
 buying assets in the is cheaper and thus may increase raising profits made overseas by firms increase in terms of pounds explained
 not beneficial to if the demand for imports is price inelastic then the value of imports might actually rise which is quite likely for commodity imports such as oil etc
 max rising import prices may drive up the costs of manufacturers and final goods hence causing cost push inflation within the economy and offsetting some of the benefits of the weaker pound causing job losses in importdependent sectors
 possible risk of demand pull inflation as a result of rising exports but max in total for understanding that inflation will rise through push or pull

 examiners should also be prepared to award zero marks if the response is not worthy of credit according to the mark scheme
 where some judgement is required mark schemes will provide the principles by which marks will be awarded and exemplification may be limited
 when examiners are in doubt regarding the application of the mark scheme to a response the team leader must be consulted
 history marking guidance marking of levels of response the mark scheme provides an indication of the sorts of answer that might be found at different levels
 it is intended as a guide and it will be necessary therefore for examiners to use their professional judgement in deciding both at which level a question has been answered and how effectively points have been sustained
 candidates should always be rewarded according to the quality of thought expressed in their answer and not solely according to the amount of knowledge conveyed
 however candidates with only a superficial knowledge will be unable to develop or sustain points sufficiently to move to higher levels
 at the end of each answer examiners should look back on the answer as a whole in the light of these general criteria in order to ensure that the total mark reflects their overall impression of the worth
 deciding on the mark point within a level the first stage is to decide the overall level and then whether the work represents high mid or low performance within the level
 one stronger passage at level would not by itself merit a level award but it would be evidence to support a high level award unless there were also substantial weaknesses in other areas

 in arguing that the weimar republic was successful during this period candidates may focus on the political stability of the period from particularly if seen relative to the preceding years
 whilst still reliant on political coalitions these oversaw a period of relative political and economic harmony with the electoral success and activity of extreme groups being reduced
 candidates may point to the drop in support for the communist parties with the down to of the vote in the elections or highlight the involvement of in coalition government during this period
 the role of leaders such as stresemann and hindenburg may also be examined through arguments that they brought success and stability through policy achievements and acceptability to a broad selection of the electorate
 however such arguments may be offset by considering the extent to which instability prevented the success of democratic government with the absence of the from coalition government until minority coalitions and frequent changes in the chancellorship
 at level some successes may be examined although the response may be very with the case probably being made that across the wider period the weimar republic had little by the way of success
 early decrees undoubtedly increased military production as hitler sought to expand the war economy from but the extent to which this was efficiently organised is military expenditure doubled from with of workers engaged in production yet output was disappointing
 candidates may make comparisons with the military output of britain or russia in this period with the former producing more aircraft and the latter more tanks
 the extent to which this was a result of the overlapping structure of the nazi war economy may also feature under the differing remits of the ministry of armaments office of the four year plan and other agencies
 candidates may indeed highlight the contradiction in a regime short of resources and labour allocating such a proportion of these to the final solution
 candidates may focus on the meeting between samuel hoare and pierre laval in december and the subsequent pact which agreed to divide abyssinia largely in favour of italy with the of being retained as sovereign territory
 however the focus should be firmly on the british handling of the crisis and as such extensive detail on other issues such as the growing relationship between the fascist powers is not a requirement
 at level look for sustained and well supported evaluation culminating in an impressive conclusion with candidates likely to make critical distinctions over both the disastrous and confused
 at level there should be some analysis of the impact of the abyssinian crisis although the response is likely to be very perhaps with limited consideration of the wider context
 mark number indicative content this question invites candidates to consider british performance in the early years of and assess the extent to which this can be seen as a success
 at level look for sustained and well supported evaluation culminating in an impressive conclusion with candidates likely to explore the nature and extent of many of the above examples in the context of the wider war
 at level there should be some analysis of the success of british efforts although this may be somewhat imbalanced in terms of either or in terms of theatres of war examined
 mark from kaiser to germany question number indicative content this question centres on whether or not the responsibility for the outbreak of the first world war lay with the german leadership
 source also highlights the role of leaders although it considers this in more reactive terms and thus apportions responsibility in the context of international developments alongside the pessimistic fears of leaders
 source points more towards how the july crisis triggered the alliances that had developed in the context of increasing nationalism and the arms race
 such issues may be developed with specific knowledge of the arms race and the alliance system and are likely to focus on the role germany played in both of these
 at level there will be a sustained and evaluative argument precisely supported from both the sources and considerable own knowledge
 at level there should be a real debate on whether the policies and decisions of leaders proved decisive in bringing about war
 candidates in conducting this debate will show a real awareness of the different perspectives of the three sources which will be expanded upon
 mark number indicative content this question addresses the nature of the nazi regime and the extent to which this was genuinely popular
 in developing these issues candidates may even examine the extent to which such a faith in their leader did exist amongst ordinary germans or was a manufactured construct of and the use of propaganda
 at level there will be a sustained and evaluative argument precisely supported from both the sources and considerable own knowledge
 at level there should be a real debate showing a real awareness of the different perspectives of the three sources which will be expanded upon
 at level candidates should begin to integrate the sources and own knowledge probably producing a rather case supporting the proposition
 at level there may be some cross referencing of the sources or even extensive own knowledge displayed possibly on some aspects of propaganda or hitler
 mark britain and the challenge of saving europe at a question number indicative content this question targets the controversy surrounding policy of appeasement
 candidates may begin with source which can be identified with the proposition in the question highlighting actions from march to september as being the apogee of this policy
 candidates may develop the arguments within source that expansionist aims were evident before this and that appeasement encouraged hitler in thinking he would not be opposed
 source argues in a similar vein in some respects in so far as britain and france failed to recognise that a firmer line against hitler was possible highlighting how hitler achieved much of his aims through brinkmanship
 source offers a different view highlighting what chamberlain achieved in the context of public opinion british and french capabilities and their attempts to reshape territorial claims and treaty revision
 candidates may relate this to source regarding own limited capacity in or in contrasting the hope of settlement it portrays with the encouragement this gave to hitler that source highlights
 whilst candidates may extend the debate beyond this should be firmly focused back on assessing the policy followed during this period
 at level there will be a sustained and evaluative argument precisely supported from both the sources and considerable own knowledge
 candidates in conducting this debate will show a real awareness of the different perspectives of the three sources which will be expanded upon
 candidates may draw on this to develop arguments suggesting a successful reconstruction highlighting issues such as the growth of manufacturing output the growth of exports and efforts to tackle potential inflation
 at level there will be a sustained and evaluative argument precisely supported from both the sources and considerable own knowledge
 the latter may be deployed in making a case relating to reconstruction with a sharp focus on both opportunities and economic improvement and candidates may explore the different conceptions of the latter
 at level there should be a real debate showing a real awareness of the different perspectives of the three sources which will be expanded upon

 june guidance some candidates may choose other theodicies such as those of aquinas irenaeus or hick which would be equally acceptable
 natural evil flows from the disorder brought into the fabric of the universe by the original sin of our ancestors both human and angelic
 free will is seen to be important as had adam and eve chosen differently evil might not have come into our world
 moral evil continues today because of free choices of humans to do evil of original of candidates should address both parts of the question to achieve level candidates may or may not agree with this statement
 some for example may argue that while credit should be given for evaluation and analysis rather than for further description of theodicies
 question mark scheme indicative content argument is basically flawed irenaeus may not fail if one held that god while giving us free will is looking for us to develop to our full potential
 june guidance others may simply hold the view that there is so much evil in our world that no benevolent god could possibly exist
 views express by thinkers such as richard swinburne peter vardy michael ruse mackie phillips john hick dostoevsky or richard dawkins may be put to good use in these responses

 question mark scheme indicative content others may explain the omphalos argument which argues that the appearance of age was put in the world by god despite the earth actually being young
 june guidance finally candidates may explain that among creationists it is generally accepted that progressive creationism a form of old earth creationism is the most popular view
 great deal of modern science can be incorporated into this position where the big bang can be seen as evidence of the creative power of god
 however they would not hold with progressive evolution believing rather that god created of organisms in the order seen in the fossil record and that newer were specially created not mutated from earlier forms
 those who hold with the progressive creationist view may start by assessing the way the big bang theory could be included within their views
 candidates may then explore the way that copleston builds on part of argument drawing heavily on principle of sufficient see quotation opposite
 first of all should say we know that there are at least some beings in the world which do not contain in themselves the reason for their existence
 now secondly the world is simply the real or imagined totality or aggregate of individual objects none of which contain in themselves alone the reason for their existence
 therefore should say since objects or events exist and since no object of experience contains within itself reason of its existence this reason the totality of objects must have a reason external to itself
 june guidance hume also said that we have no experience of a universe being created and so we cannot talk meaningfully about it
 candidates may begin by explaining that aristotle was a greek philosopher who arrived at the concept of the prime mover through his observations of cause and effect

 at level candidates are required to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding and their ability to sustain a critical line of argument in greater depth and over a wider range of content than at level
 select and demonstrate clearly relevant knowledge and understanding through the use of evidence examples and correct language and terminology appropriate to the course of study
 in order to ensure the marking scheme can be and consistently and to examiners to mark in a standardised it defines levels of response by which answers are assessed
 this ensures that comparable standards are applied across the various units as well as within the team of examiners marking a particular unit
 in candidates answer a single question but are reminded by a rubric of the need to address both objectives in their answers
 in the marking scheme each question is provided with a brief outline of the likely content lines of argument of a answer but this is by no means prescriptive or exhaustive
 mark scheme june examiners must not attempt to reward answers according to the extent to which they match the structure of the outline or mention the points it contains
 the specification is designed to allow teachers to approach the content of modules in a variety of ways from any of a number of perspectives and answers must be assessed in the light of this flexibility of approach
 it is quite possible for an excellent and valid answer to contain knowledge and arguments which do not appear in the each answer must be assessed on its own merits according to the levels of response
 synoptic skills and the ability to make these are now assessed at as specification due to the removal of the connections papers
 question mark scheme indicative content candidates are likely to begin with a brief definition of both myths and symbols
 some may for example explain the belief that mythology can be seen as a way of understanding a deeper reality
 some candidates may choose to make reference to bultmann but should be clear that his project was to demythologise scripture to reveal the kerygma not to support the use of myth to talk about god
 he makes the distinction between a sign which is merely a matter of convention and a symbol which not only points towards something but also participates in that to which it points
 the union flag for example represents a unity which may not exist later this year and new symbols to represent a new reality may be needed
 for this specific question candidates may legitimately move beyond symbolic language into more general issues of symbolism provided the material is relevantly used
 question mark scheme indicative content contain very strong symbolic elements and may give appropriate examples to illustrate the point
 june marks guidance some candidates may make use of the question of what exactly tillich meant by participating in that to which a symbol points as a major part of their evaluation
 they may for example explore his idea that a term can be both and by the reality of god
 they may for example use their knowledge of the logical positivists to explore issues of both myth and symbol which would seem to have little to do with an empirical view of the world
 if they do take this route though they must focus their critiques on the ideas of myth and symbol and not just produce a preprepared answer on the vienna circle
 it would of course be perfectly valid for them to conclude that neither of these concepts is helpful in talking about god
 they may start with the dualism which was common in greek thought where they had the idea that a soul which was wholly spiritual was separate from the material body
 this allowed plato to maintain that the soul is eternal which for him meant not only that it had no end but that it had no beginning either
 this meant that it was not capable of critically assess the views of john hick and plato on the distinction between body and soul
 responses which produce simple listing rather than answering the question with assessment are unlikely to be able to access the higher levels
 question mark scheme indicative content destruction as it was a simple substance which had no parts into which to disintegrate
 candidates may point out that plato believed that the true home of the soul was the realm of the forms whereas the body was temporary and corruptible
 hick strongly opposed this platonic view of the soul partly because he could not accept that the soul is immortal in itself
 as with aquinas hick would say soul is not in this sense he is closer to aristotle believing that we are our bodies but that these bodies have a spiritual dimension
 this may lead candidates to explain why when he considered the afterlife he developed his replica theory which argued that when we die god creates a replica of ourselves in a resurrection world
 some candidates may be aware that hick amended his views as his philosophical ideas developed moving to a more dualist view as a result of his interest in telepathy and reincarnation
 marks june guidance question mark scheme indicative content june marks guidance some candidates may explore the classical weaknesses in form of dualism perhaps even using the work of his pupil aristotle as a starting point
 it is however important that the focus of their responses is on plato and hick and not a on a summary of the history of the dualist materialist debate
 candidates may begin by explaining the work of rudolf otto the german thinker who argued that there is one common factor to all religious experience independent of the cultural background
 he also argued that the numinous experience has a personal quality to it in that the person feels to be in communion with a wholly other
 some may argue that a numinous experience like all other religious experiences is simply delusional brought on by an extreme diet or a psychotic episode
 they have a range of miracles to explore most of which are focused on saying something about the nature of god and his activity in the world
 aquinas who focused on biblical miracles emphasised their revelatory responses may observe that both aquinas and the biblical writings approach the matter from a perspective
 in the old testament for example they may point to the destructive nature of many of the recorded miracles from the judgement on sodom and gomorrah to the ten plagues
 candidates may acceptably mention other miracles but these need either to relate to or exemplify something of the biblical concept of miracles
 responses may have used century scholarly critiques which look at biblical miracles in terms of their historicity possible mythic characteristics and a need for reinterpretation thereof
 marks some candidates may explore the context in which these miracles took place and the issues they raise for philosophers particularly those philosophers who believe in the god of classical theism
 they may argue than in scripture god is continually involved in guiding his miracles are simply conspicuous examples of his activity
 they may for example raise problems such as those mentioned by wiles who asks whether or not such a god is worthy of worship

 mark schemes are prepared by the principal examiner and considered together with the relevant questions by a panel of subject teachers
 this mark scheme includes any amendments made at standardisation events which all examiners participate in and is the scheme which was used by them in this examination
 the standardisation process ensures that the mark scheme covers the responses to questions and that every examiner understands and applies it in the same correct way
 as preparation for standardisation each examiner analyses a number of alternative answers not already covered by the mark scheme are discussed and legislated for
 if after the standardisation process examiners encounter unusual answers which have not been raised they are required to refer these to the principal examiner
 it must be stressed that a mark scheme is a working document in many cases further developed and expanded on the basis of reactions to a particular paper
 assumptions about future mark schemes on the basis of one document should be whilst the guiding principles of assessment remain constant details will change depending on the content of a particular examination paper
 verbal answers in english the basic principle of assessment is that candidates should gain credit for what they know understand and can do
 however these aspects are an integral part of assessing communication and marks cannot be awarded where errors in spelling punctuation or grammar lead to a failure to communicate the required information without ambiguity
 where a candidate has given alternatives or additional information in answer the following criteria should be if the does not contradict the key idea or make it ambiguous if the contradicts the key idea or makes it ambiguous reject
 where numbered lines are given within a of a question credit should be given for correct answers no matter which line they appear on
 where a question has more than one section a candidate may include as part of the answer to one section the information required to answer another section
 in questions where candidates are asked to name for example three types of vegetable sold in the market only the first three items they write down should be considered
 if the rubric instructs them to write one letter or number in the box and they do so but write a second letter or number outside the box too then the answer in the box should be considered

 registered company number with its registered office at edinburgh gate harlow essex holden ever play in mixed communities in sociology review volume number issues of integration in ethnically diverse areas are often the subject of social and political debate
 in this research andrew holden focused on play in local park playgrounds and school playgrounds spaces occupied by children from different ethnic groups
 he wanted to examine the extent to which play at different ages and in different settings either reinforces or overcomes the segregation of different ethnic groups
 he aimed to establish what the parents felt about integrative play and whether they thought it could have a positive effect on communities
 in the first three months of the study he carried out secondary research to build up a detailed background knowledge
 substantial amount of information was collected from published documents such as the census the local play strategy early years publications and website material
 three months into the study during the spring and summer months holden carried out a series of overt observations which gathered mainly quantitative data
 total of observations were conducted in public parks and school playgrounds spaces occupied by children from two main ethnic groups and where one might expect to see some integrative play taking place
 the parks chosen were three largest parks two of which were situated in heavily areas and one which was in a mixed community
 these six schools were chosen on the basis of their ethnic and cultural diversity and none of the schools had less than a white or asian population
 the observational data was recorded on a structured schedule the purpose of which was to identify the nature and extent of play in blackburn and to establish whether play was integrated or segregated
 shortly after the observations had taken place a parental attitudes survey was carried out in the form of a structured questionnaire
 the aim of the survey was to establish what parents thought about integrative play and to consider how this could be best facilitated
 using opportunity sampling the researchers gained access to the parents of children from each ethnic group in a variety of public settings including schools colleges community centres and workplaces
 the results of the park observations showed that although there was plenty of free play happening there was very little integrative play between different ethnic groups
 white and asian children played in close proximity with each other but there were few signs of conversation between different ethnic groups and no real evidence of mixing
 in contrast the primary school observations revealed that during their playtime the children engaged positively with members of different ethnic groups
 play was lively and spontaneous and consisted of groups of children who enjoyed playing together and for whom ethnic membership seemed insignificant
 over of white and of asian parents stated that it was either very important or fairly important for children from different ethnic groups to play together
 although integrative play was more common in schools than parks there were also variations in play between the different educational sectors

 mark schemes are prepared by the principal examiner and considered together with the relevant questions by a panel of subject teachers
 this mark scheme includes any amendments made at the standardisation events which all examiners participate in and is the scheme which was used by them in this examination
 the standardisation process ensures that the mark scheme covers the responses to questions and that every examiner understands and applies it in the same correct way
 as preparation for standardisation each examiner analyses a number of alternative answers not already covered by the mark scheme are discussed and legislated for
 if after the standardisation process examiners encounter unusual answers which have not been raised they are required to refer these to the principal examiner
 it must be stressed that a mark scheme is a working document in many cases further developed and expanded on the basis of reactions to a particular paper
 assumptions about future mark schemes on the basis of one document should be whilst the guiding principles of assessment remain constant details will change depending on the content of a particular examination paper
 verbal answers in english the basic principle of assessment is that candidates should gain credit for what they know understand and can do
 however these aspects are an integral part of assessing communication and marks cannot be awarded where errors in spelling punctuation or grammar lead to a failure to communicate the required information without ambiguity
 where a candidate has given alternatives or additional information in answer the following criteria should be if the does not contradict the key idea or make it ambiguous if the contradicts the key idea or makes it ambiguous reject
 where numbered lines are given within a of a question credit should be given for correct answers no matter which line they appear on
 where a question has more than one section a candidate may include as part of the answer to one section the information required to answer another section
 in questions where candidates are asked to name for example three types of vegetable sold in the market only the first three items they write down should be considered

 the standardisation meeting ensures that the mark scheme covers the responses to questions and that every examiner understands and applies it in the same correct way
 as preparation for the standardisation meeting each examiner analyses a number of alternative answers not already covered by the mark scheme are discussed at the meeting and legislated for
 if after this meeting examiners encounter unusual answers which have not been discussed at the meeting they are required to refer these to the principal examiner
 it must be stressed that a mark scheme is a working document in many cases further developed and expanded on the basis of reactions to a particular paper
 assumptions about future mark schemes on the basis of one document should be whilst the guiding principles of assessment remain constant details will change depending on the content of a particular examination paper
 the extra information is aligned to the appropriate answer in the part of the mark scheme and should only be applied to that item in the mark scheme
 in general the right hand side of the mark scheme is there to provide those extra details which confuse the main part of the mark scheme yet may be helpful in ensuring that marking is straightforward and consistent
 emboldening in a list of acceptable answers where more than one mark is available two is used with the number of marks emboldened

 all examiners are instructed that alternative correct answers and unexpected approaches in scripts must be given marks that fairly reflect the relevant knowledge and skills demonstrated
 be careful to listen to the performance in such a way as to be able to make clear distinctions between each category of the assessment criteria and award marks appropriately
 if there is a gap of a few days between assessing groups of candidates it may be useful to plan to listen again to some candidates to make sure that you apply consistent standards
 similarly it is a good idea to listen to some candidates from the previous assessment series each time you start a new round of assessments
 if you have a report from the previous series take the comments into they can be very helpful in developing a consistent approach
 they express and explain ideas and points of view and produce longer sequences of speech using a variety of vocabulary structures and verb tenses
 mark scheme june grade candidates take part in conversations and simple discussions which contain a variety of structures and may include different tenses or time frames
 marking should be positive rewarding achievement and the production of successful language throughout the test rather than penalising failure or omissions
 in each of the three categories quality of language and pronunciation and try to locate the candidate in a band initially and then allocate a mark within that band
 do this only once the test is complete so that your mark can be global it is usually best to mark immediately at the end of the test whilst the performance is still fresh in your mind
 to select the most appropriate mark within the band use the following where the work convincingly meets the statement the higher mark should be awarded where the work just meets the statement the lower mark should be awarded
 teachers should use the full range of marks available and must award the top mark in any band for work which fully meets the description
 this is work which is best that could be expected from students working at this one mark per assessment category is required
 communicates no relevant information mark scheme june quality of language marks confident and accurate use of a wide variety of clause types vocabulary and structures including verb structures and tenses
 very fluent coherent and consistent only one or two instances of minor errors usually in the most ambitious language
 nothing coherent or accurate enough to be comprehensible pronunciation and intonation marks very accurate for a language speaker though there may be some minor slips
 mark scheme june communication marks when assessing the work for communication teachers must consider both parts of the assessment the part of the role and the unexpected element
 teachers must ask unexpected questions to elicit a spontaneous response based on the prepared work and their knowledge of the ability
 if a candidate shows that as well as communicating the essential elements of the topic they can deal with these unexpected questions with only occasional hesitation teachers should award within the band for communication
 similarly to access full marks for communication candidates must respond fully to all tasks and unexpected questions and have developed and justified their ideas and points of view
 to be able to do this they will have to be able to use a variety of tenses vocabulary and structures as specified within the grammar list in the specification
 in band candidates are allowed occasional these may be major and cause ambiguity in complex structures though they will be few in number

 select and demonstrate clearly relevant knowledge and understanding through the use of evidence examples and correct language and terminology appropriate to the course of study
 in order to ensure the marking scheme can be and consistently and to examiners to mark in a standardised it defines levels of response by which answers are assessed
 this ensures that comparable standards are applied across the various units as well as within the team of examiners marking a particular unit
 in candidates answer a single question but are reminded by a rubric of the need to address both objectives in their answers
 in the marking scheme each question is provided with a brief outline of the likely content lines of argument of a answer but this is by no means prescriptive or exhaustive
 mark scheme june examiners must not attempt to reward answers according to the extent to which they match the structure of the outline or mention the points it contains
 the specification is designed to allow teachers to approach the content of modules in a variety of ways from any of a number of perspectives and answers must be assessed in the light of this flexibility of approach
 it is quite possible for an excellent and valid answer to contain knowledge and arguments which do not appear in the each answer must be assessed on its own merits according to the levels of response
 synoptic skills and the ability to make these are now assessed at as specification due to the removal of the connections papers
 question mark scheme indicative content june marks candidates are likely to consider the distinction between and discuss the status of sruti and smriti literature
 since sruti is which is it is considered to be of divine origin while smriti means which is and therefore although it might be thought of as divinely inspired it has less authority
 candidates might also consider this in relation to change or adaptation of the sruti texts are believed to be preserved in their original forms no human authorship is generally attributed to them
 guidance question mark scheme indicative content june marks candidates might argue that sruti literature is less widely read or used because the language in which it is written is less accessible
 while sanskrit is still a living language vedic sanskrit is a particular form of it and this may prevent some hindus from reading sruti texts
 if it is in less common use and less popular with ordinary hindus it could be argued that it is less important to the religion as practised today
 because sruti literature is used in worship by priests it could be argued that it retains a significance in some forms of practice even if it is not particularly significant for most hindus
 the vedas are the foundation of hinduism and the yajna they describe are carried out by priests even when no other worshippers are present
 sruti also provides the basis for many foundational philosophical concepts and so candidates might argue that these scriptures remain extremely important even if not widely read
 alternatively candidates might consider concepts within hinduism such as dharma which are important to most hindus and on which smriti literature has more to say
 some candidates might build their discussion on the idea of disputed status arguing that popular texts being treated as sruti in popular practice implies that the designation still communicates a higher status
 guidance question mark scheme indicative content candidates are likely to be aware that the bhagavad gita is part of a larger epic and that it is one of the more popular hindu texts
 candidates might also give an account of the contents but this should be done in relation to the issue of the nature of god
 krishna appears as a character in the gita and it is in conversation with krishna that the main teachings of the text are explained
 candidates might argue that this setting itself communicates some understanding about divinity in hinduism since krishna is an avatar of vishnu
 they might choose to connect this with accounts of krishna from other source to identify areas where the bhagavad gita is silent
 however they might also note that the text also refers to moksha and consider what that tells hindus about the nature of god
 candidates might explain that the bhagavad gita has been interpreted as explaining the relationship between atman and brahman in a variety of different ways
 however it could also be argued that the emphasis on practical ways to achieve liberation does communicate something about god although not directly
 the implication is that how this life is managed is more important for personal liberation than speculating on the nature of the divine
 candidates might also argue that the different yogas demonstrate that different people can reach god in different ways and the path of knowledge is not accessible for everyone
 they might discuss whether krishna is a deity in his own right or whether he represents one aspect of god
 guidance question mark scheme indicative content candidates are likely to identify moksha as liberation from the cycle of samsara
 they might then relate this concept to other aspects of hindu life and teaching such as outlining hindu beliefs about life death and rebirth and relating the concept of karma to rebirth and to moksha
 june marks guidance question mark scheme indicative content june marks candidates might argue that however hindus understand moksha they are all aiming for it and it is therefore a uniting feature
 since it can be connected to so many different concepts ideals and teachings within hinduism arguably cannot be properly understood without understanding it can certainly be argued that moksha is a central feature of hinduism
 the existence of moksha could remain a unifying concept if it is recognised that the best understanding people are currently able to achieve is only ever going to be partial and ineffable
 the four margas might be discussed in this context and used to argue that the unifying feature of hinduism is in fact its recognition that there is no one single path which is suitable for everyone
 candidates might also consider whether other concepts such as varnashramadharma are followed with less divergence amongst hindus and have more practical application in the everyday life of the worshipper
 guidance question mark scheme indicative content candidates are likely to begin by outlining the core features of both schools of thought
 by contrast in vishistadvaita brahman is both infinite foundational reality and the unitary form of individual souls alternatively candidates might examine the ways in which people can attain moksha
 however candidates might also be aware that although jnana is the means by which liberation is ultimately achieved sankara did recognise that people might still benefit from bhakti in the early stages of their path to liberation
 by contrast the vishishtadvaita might appear to be making a contradictory claim with its recognition of multiple souls and candidates might explore whether the presentation of this as a approach is sustainable
 it could also be argued that vishishtadvaita vedanta is more considerate of human experience in allowing for some sense of individuation consistent with human experience of the world

 students should recognise that food production is now global with very few parts of the world sitting outside a global supply chain this has implications for the environment this might be illustrated by land deals made in africa e
 changes which have not had such negative impacts are often smallscale and crucially do not always increase food indeed they are not always intended to do so
 the scale of the global problem for supply does pose real challenges for the environment and the picture to date is not good
 so the best answers will show a strong conceptual understanding and cogent argument and counter argument with a range of reasons offered why the environment is impacted negatively
 case studies used are likely to crops in specific location such as south other ways of increasing commercial agriculture intensification
 specific examples of to what extent is it true that the least culturally diverse places are the most geographically explore the physical and human factors which influence the degree of cultural diversity
 the focus of this title is whether or not there is a correlation between cultural diversity and with the emphasis on poorly connected places
 this needs some definition it could be distance but better seen as a combination of that and other factors such as difficulty of access interior and whether it is a place that is passed through to reach others
 in most cases this is explained by geographical factors although social and political factors also play a part for example the least culturally diverse cities in the used to be southern and cities
 london is the uks most ethnically and culturally diverse city as new york is in the culturally diverse places are often clearly demarcated on the ground with particular districts dominated by one group or another
 so in summary isolated places tend to lack cultural diversity but isolation is not simply a product of geography but also a function of attitudes both on the part of governments and society as a whole
 their conclusions will be clearly stated with explicit references to title and obvious view taken about the role of geographic isolation
 the focus of this title is the degree to which status in a range of spheres can be held accountable for variations in health risk from place to place and from time to time
 key analytical health risk can be expressed in two dimensions geographic extent and threat to individuals so both breadth and depth of risk
 is a phrase that needs deconstructing carefully some students will include reasonably enough health risks associated with quality of built environment sewage disposal and lack of access to freshwater
 poorer countries have lower life expectancy poorer people have lower life expectancy some diseases may be a product of development suggesting an inverse relationship between development and health risk
 so in summary the most significant variable explaining variations in life expectancy is per capita this works better within countries than between them
 the reasons are related to the environment both directly as in the threat posed and indirectly as in critically the ability to deal with it
 the best answers will use a strong conceptual understanding and cogent argument and counter argument with a range of reason offered for the role of status
 they will demonstrate an appreciation of different and clearly identified arguments about the relationship between environmental factors and other factors such as poverty
 conclusions will be clearly stated with explicit references to title and obvious view taken about the role of status when compared with others
 case studies used are likely to polluted cities indian villages malaria in africa obesity in europe from rural landscapes are more vulnerable to the impacts of leisure and tourism than discuss
 key analytical vulnerability needs to be understood as a consequence of the stability of a landscape mountain areas are more fragile than lowland areas because less energy is required to stimulate a change
 so in summary some landscapes are more vulnerable than others because they are more or less fragile but also the pressures vary from place to place both human and natural
 the best answers will address this showing a strong conceptual understanding and the use of cogent argument and counter argument with a range of reason offered for varying vulnerability
 they will demonstrate an appreciation of different and clearly identified on what constitutes vulnerability and how it can be evaluated
 their conclusions will be stated with explicit references to title and obvious view taken about the reasons for varying fragility with extended points made

 some jewish practices may be impractical in contemporary society and these traditions should be adapted if the religion is to remain relevant
 although supernatural aspects of religion are widely rejected judaism still provides the basis for the morality of many societies through the ten commandments
 many mitzvot do not have an obvious rational basis and are more important to obey for this reason as they demonstrate greater faith

 occasional syntactical spelling errors may be found but they will not impede coherent deployment of the material and argument
 the candidate will demonstrate most of the skills needed to produce effective extended writing but there will be lapses in organisation
 thus most candidates whose religious understanding related to a given question suggests that they should sit in a particular level will express that understanding in ways which broadly conform to the communication descriptor appropriate to that level

 if after this meeting examiners encounter unusual answers which have not been discussed at the meeting they are required to refer these to the principal examiner
 it must be stressed that a mark scheme is a working document in many cases further developed and expanded on the basis of reactions to a particular paper
 assumptions about future mark schemes on the basis of one document should be whilst the guiding principles of assessment remain constant details will change depending on the content of a particular examination paper

 very good synthesis and synoptic assessment of the whole period level uses a wide range of accurate and relevant evidence accurate and confident use of appropriate historical terminology answer is clearly structured and communicates accurately and legibly
 candidates who clearly define different types of division unity for example politically territorially religiously socially and economically are most likely to be successful
 such an approach is likely to enable them to make regular synoptic comparisons between the earlier and later periods throughout the essay
 when considering the period from to candidates may argue that germany achieved a form of unity under the domination of napoleon and through the creation of the confederation of the rhine
 germany was then certainly very divided from as a consequence of decisions taken at the congress of vienna though it could also be argued that the german confederation from loosely bound most germans into a confederation with a diet
 candidates may argue that the revolutions of make manifestly clear just how divided germany was at that point in history
 they may argue that it was a prussian empire rather than a german it certainly did not unite all the german people even geographically
 the exclusion of austria from the process of german unification may be dealt with though candidates may refer to creation of the dual alliance as significant
 divisions within germany after might be illustrated through the kulturkampf and the rise of socialism or the domination of the reich by the elites
 candidates may argue that the development of more radical nationalism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century demonstrates an emergence of greater national unity in germany during this mark guidance examiners must be open to alternative approaches
 candidates who approach the question synoptically by analysing and comparing each potential turning impact on german nationalism in terms of issues such as political social and economic developments are likely to be highly successful
 those who make comparisons with both the named turning point and other possible turning points in each paragraph so that synthesis is clearly present are likely to be very successful
 candidates who argue in favour of are likely to focus on the impact on germany of the final defeat of napoleon and the consequences of the congress of vienna
 question mark scheme answer represented the victory of prussia against austria for control over the future of germany and therefore provides the most important in the course of german nationalism
 others might argue that without appointment as president prussia would have lacked the leadership needed to enable either of these crucial victories to be won
 others too might argue that industrial power was of critical importance and place great significance on the consequences of the establishment of the zollverein
 candidates may argue that the core aim of german nationalists the creation and development of a united german nation remained the same throughout this period
 candidates may argue that the common fight of people from different german states against the french especially in gave strong impulses to nationalism
 candidates might well demonstrate understanding of the debate about grossdeutschland or kleindeutschland in the period and the reasons for the development of more radical nationalism in the remainder of the period
 arguably this demonstrated that intellectual liberal nationalism was unlikely to lead the drive towards unification and led to others turning to the growing power of prussia to provide the leadership and means
 candidates might explain the importance of economic developments on the changing aims of german nationalism for example the impact of the zollverein after on the industrial development of prussia
 candidates may argue that economic and industrial strength gave the prussians the military strength and power to profoundly change the nature of german nationalism replacing june mark guidance examiners must be open to alternative approaches
 the impact of the foundation of the second reich from clearly had a profound effect on the development of nationalism during the latter part of this period
 candidates are likely to discuss the reasons for the development of more radical nationalism in the remainder of the period and the reasons for the divergence between german liberals and other nationalists from in imperial germany
 different definitions of public opinion can be expected and examiners need to be aware that political pressure on elites can come in many forms
 synoptic themes might be developments in state structures for example the development of more democratic forms of government more effective forms of media that informed public opinion as the period developed
 with regard to specific content arguments that public opinion was not ignored might include the early part of the revolutionary wars where the french republic was fighting perhaps an ideological war for its existence
 napoleon might be used both ways for example with the importance of public opinion fluctuating with changes in the question mark scheme june answer military situation at given points in time
 the impact of rising nationalism on all of the wars of this period provides many obvious examples for candidates to use in support of analysis
 both world wars have a lot of potential with regard to the question with discussions of propaganda different forms of media and censorship
 mark guidance to what extent was the war of the most important turning point in the impact of weapons technology on war in the period from to examiners must be open to alternative approaches
 there is no reason why a given turning point cannot be selected as the main point of development with regard one aspect of weapons technology but not with regard another
 the war is an obvious potential turning point in the impact of weapons technology on warfare because of the introduction of breech loading weapons
 the prussian army and some of its allies used these weapons normally the dreyse needle gun whereas the austrians retained muzzle loading muskets which used minie technology
 for example the austrians used superior artillery technology which to an extent equalised the situation for example at the final battle of koniggratz
 other potential turning points might be the introduction of small arms with percussion caps rifling and minie ammunition in the period
 examiners might expect candidates to argue that weapons technology did not change in the revolutionary and napoleonic wars but rifled small arms were used and artillery had become lighter and easier to move by the time of these conflicts
 as the period went on artillery was increasingly used in the indirect fire role this is first encountered as a standard technique in the war
 wars were how far do you agree with this view of the period from to candidates will have to be able to define what the concept total war means suggestions follow
 in this regard candidates need to be aware of the continental and increasingly global nature of warfare in the revolutionary and napoleonic wars and the first and second world wars
 these potential themes are by no means exhaustive and examiners need to be aware of novel approaches to the term total war indeed such a response might be the mark of a better script
 the four or five wars cited above all saw mass conscription conflict over large areas of europe or the globe mass mobilisation of economies and a style of warfare which increasingly attacked entire societies
 candidates might argue that these wars were limited in their nature geographically economically and that they had very limited military objectives
 for example the two german wars of unification did require a substantial effort on the part of prussia and her allies to achieve victory
 the crimean war and the italian war of are less convincing as total wars with their limited objectives and commitment of the combatant powers
 nationalism attracted more support than revolutionary how far do you agree with this view of the period from to candidates will need to assess and compare the support given to constitutional and revolutionary nationalism throughout the period
 however candidates could point to the growing support for the united irishmen amongst the professional and middle classes which translated into the largest revolutionary rising in the period wolfe tone although much of this was agrarian inspired
 this was in part because of its aims and methods which forced it underground although amongst the diaspora it gained considerable support loyalty and money the crucial test for support was votes
 not until sinn fein in did it pursue this route transforming itself with the new electorate post the pre irish electorate supported constitutional nationalism
 however candidates could point out that constitutional nationalism collapsed re support at the end of the period and nonetheless throughout most of the period many june mark guidance examiners must be open to alternative approaches
 question mark scheme answer irish seemed indifferent to nationalism although and davitt in the land war did manage mobilise numbers
 within east ulster and belfast unionism via the orange lodges and sectarian employment policies reinforced post with covenants militarisation and leadership monopolised support which was neither revolutionary or constitutional in the traditional senses of the word
 how far did the methods of protestants in ulster change in the period from to candidates are likely to start their answers by making a statement about the aims of protestants in ulster
 there will probably be some discussion of the to preserve the union to strengthen the economic dominance of ulster and to maintain social segregation between protestants and catholics
 it is reasonable for candidates to suggest that to a greater or lesser extent these aims remained the same throughout the period
 however by the end of the period the idea of defending the union had been modified to one which focused on defending ulster as part of the union
 by the middle of the nineteenth century the in ulster was using propaganda to attack church disestablishment land reform and proposed home rule
 with respect to the latter by the beginning of the twentieth century the aims of protestants started to change with a new emphasis being placed on the enactment of home rule with for ulster
 to support the early momentum towards defending the union an evangelical revival was political and were intertwined by individuals such as revd hugh hanna of belfast to ensure a united ulster protestant opposition to the emerging polity
 also by the time that the home rule question was really coming to a head ulster protestants were adept at negotiating support from senior conservatives on the mainland such as lord randolph churchill and joe chamberlain
 however there were times when the protestants in ulster veered towards using methods that were more in nature and that were often violent
 question mark scheme june answer radical anglicans such as tone united to open rebel against the authority of the elite
 by the middle of the nineteenth century violence was frequently used by protestant such as william johnson of ballykilbeg to control the labour supply in ulster
 mark guidance issues were the most important factor in the development of irish how far would you agree with this view in the period from to examiners must be open to alternative approaches
 candidates might argue that they were very important citing a sense of colonial grievance that exploited ireland economically and had been based on land expropriation exacerbated by the famine
 agrarian issues were a key element in mobilising support for nationalism especially in the mid century with the tithe war the tenants league and land war of both revolutionary and constitutional nationalism exploited this
 however whilst important in the and especially in the and it could be argued that agrarian issues played a very secondary role in nationalism throughout
 the focus of nationalism was predominantly political its aims being home rule or independence its methods erring to the democratic and party political with the exception of leaders like davitt and lalor
 most of the key leaders were political in approach focusing on parliamentary tactics connell parnell and or an armed uprising emmett davis de valera pearce and none had a very developed economic policy beyond land for the irish
 candidates are likely to compare and contrast the tsarist and communist rulers in respect of their aims policies and methods of government in order to assess their attitudes towards change
 candidates could argue that stalin was even more revolutionary arguing that his economic social policies in the utterly transformed the which was emerging as a global superpower
 others may suggest that alexander supported social change as he began his reign with the promise of from and that his reforms of the most especially the emancipation of the serfs represented a real change
 candidates considering different types of change may argue that whilst alexander was resolutely opposed to political change he allowed witte to introduce significant economic change for military reasons
 candidates may also assert that despite the revolutionary nature of their doctrine lenin and stalin both exhibited reactionary tendencies pursuing policies that have led many historians to refer to communist dictatorship as simply another version of autocratic authoritarianism
 when considering the importance of turning points the ways in which they impacted on the development of russian government must be analysed
 economic reforms such as emancipation of the peasantry collectivisation and plans only become relevant when they are linked to political administrative and ideological methods and changes in government
 candidates who make comparisons with both the named turning point and other possible turning points in each paragraph so that synthesis is clearly present are likely to be very successful
 the establishment of a form of liberal democracy under the provisional government was clearly a major change in terms of the way russia was governed
 the impact on russian government was profound both centrally and locally because the authority of the nobility and the othodox church were also fatally undermined
 question mark scheme answer likely to suggest that the unintended consequence of the abdication was the creation of a power vacuum that bolsheviks were able to fill with consummate ease later that year
 candidates may consider rise to power was the most significant turning point in the development of russian government perverting the true course of the russian revolution
 candidates may suggest that victory in the power struggle led russia down a very different road than that being paved by lenin and imposed brutal totalitarianism on russia
 candidates who disagree with this view may use a based on more recent archival evidence to suggest that there was significant continuity between lenin and stalin
 candidates may argue secret speech of and marked a turning point in the development of russian government though the continuation of communism and the state way beyond negates that view
 candidates may argue the assassination of alexander in marked the end of any meaningful reform from above by the romanov dynasty setting the romanovs on course for revolution
 life under both regimes had similarities with grim living and working conditions for peasants and the urban proletariat being the norm
 candidates may illustrate their answers with a detailed comparison of the lives of the peasants before and after as they were the largest social group for much of the period
 in terms of the peasants candidates are likely to draw comparisons between serfdom and june mark guidance examiners must be open to alternative approaches
 question mark scheme answer collectivisation and the extent to which collectivisation was second candidates may want to point out that conditions were not uniform for the peasants either before or after making distinctions between periods or rulers
 arguably they gained under khrushchev because of and the virgin lands policy though candidates are likely to see the latter as a failure one of his schemes
 candidates may illustrate their answers with a detailed comparison of the living and working conditions of the proletariat in the same periods
 candidates may discuss why a marxist utopia did not emerge after in terms of the proletariat candidates are likely to draw comparisons between living and working conditions during and under five year plans and or war communism
 better candidates will be able to compare these leaders effectively to though weaker candidates will merely outline their achievements and perhaps offer a comparative analysis only in the final paragraph
 they could suggest that garvey malcolm carmichael or jackson were as inspirational as speakers and arguably had greater support among african americans
 candidates might maintain that du establishment of the to challenge discrimination in the courts its success in the brown case of was an essential for overturning jim crow
 some candidates might choose to compare king with malcolm or carmichael and suggest that impoverished black americans from inner city ghettoes could identify with them much more than with king
 it coincided with a drive to eliminate native american culture and traditions spearheaded by the carlisle indian industrial school in pennsylvania which set out to educate indian children into becoming christian americans
 alternatively it can be suggested that this policy change merely softened federal policy which continued to be hostile to native american autonomy
 many candidates will maintain that the indian new deal of the was the major suggesting that it replaced forced assimilation with respect for indian culture and customs which arguably has persisted to the present
 furthermore the indian reorganization act prevented the alienation of more tribal land and granted indian communities a measure of governmental and judicial autonomy
 the best candidates will be aware of the limitations of the indian reorganization act and the degree of opposition to it different in congress and among native americans
 the granting of citizenship in was an important step in achieving civil rights because without citizenship native americans could not claim the rights guaranteed by the constitution
 some candidates will want to argue for the second world war because it dramatically changed the lives of many native americans and federal attitudes to them
 indians served in the armed forces and a further worked in industries many of whom permanently relocated to the cities and sought to assimilate
 native american pressure group was formed in the national congress of american indians and in congress set up the indian claims commission to hear native american claims for their lost lands
 those arguing for the start or end of termination as the most significant turning point will be able to compare it to the june mark guidance examiners must be open to alternative approaches
 question mark scheme answer act period of forced assimilation as another period in which indians were encouraged to leave the reservations and adopt the mainstream white lifestyle and culture
 some candidates will opt for the nixon presidency when red power activism drew attention to native american issues and the president himself was sympathetic to their cause
 this began a phase in which congress passed a series of acts to improve conditions on native american reservations and extend indian rights and autonomy
 the supreme court also handed down a series of landmark judgements about compensation for lost lands and native american rights and about judicial authority on their reservations
 women served in the army nurse corps and the red cross took over from enlisted men the management of farms and small business and in skilled jobs in war industries
 many women who moved north with their menfolk during the great migration of also found work though largely in unskilled jobs
 although the senate dissented this was an important step towards the ratification of the amendment in candidates may decide that other issues periods were more important
 many will regard the impact of the second world war as far greater than the first because involvement was longer and mobilised more women
 some candidates might argue that neither conflict should be considered the most important factor because women still had to juggle domestic responsibilities with paid their employment gains were temporary and they and faced discrimination from employers and trade unions
 they might compare the impact of world war one with the progressive era when campaigners such as jane addams florence kelley and the national league demanded improved regulation of working conditions and health and housing reform
 some candidates may argue that for women changes in the economy than any single issue or have been fundamental to the breakdown of the assumptions which circumscribed their aspirations at the start of the period
 the periods in which the has experienced its most significant economic developments and early centuries the the second world war and the boom the have coincided with the most fundamental transformations of role and attitudes to their status
 the periods of economic expansion and development have provided greater access to white collar employment educational opportunities and consumer goods
 mark guidance was the key general election in the development of democracy in how far do you agree with this view in the period from to examiners must be open to alternative approaches
 examiners must be open to candidates will need to compare this election with others across the period in terms of relative democratic importance much will depend on the significance of each in terms of the democratic process
 thus and were significant in representing large swathes of new voters the latter reinforced by universal manhood suffrage and some female suffrage
 government business grew and the management of time with it motions in the the two world wars accelerated this and promoted government power at the expense of commons power
 government management of commons timetables select committees the decline of the independent bill commons procedures the need for funding and backing as the upper class independent gentry declined
 question mark scheme answer and the conservatives intermittently in the and and after wartime economic controls and the move to a command economy in the and pushed democratic issues health education full employment and firmly to the fore
 since economic change has had less effect on democracy given that a democratic arena had been achieved earlier although candidates could point to the increasing role of middle class women in the economy
 as in the and unemployment was an issue for governments who also became more interested in middle class and middle aged issues ie those who voted
 similarly they could argue that economic change was more important in some periods than others much depends on whether economic change is considered the determinant of all changes a marxist or simply a general backdrop to democratic development

 examiners should also be prepared to award zero marks if the response is not worthy of credit according to the mark scheme

 history marking guidance marking of levels of response the mark scheme provides an indication of the sorts of answer that might be found at different levels
 it is intended as a guide and it will be necessary therefore for examiners to use their professional judgement in deciding both at which level a question has been answered and how effectively points have been sustained
 candidates should always be rewarded according to the quality of thought expressed in their answer and not solely according to the amount of knowledge conveyed
 however candidates with only a superficial knowledge will be unable to develop or sustain points sufficiently to move to higher levels
 at the end of each answer examiners should look back on the answer as a whole in the light of these general criteria in order to ensure that the total mark reflects their overall impression of the worth
 deciding on the mark point within a level the first stage is to decide the overall level and then whether the work represents high mid or low performance within the level
 one stronger passage at level would not by itself merit a level award but it would be evidence to support a high level award unless there were also substantial weaknesses in other areas
 assessing quality of written communication qowc will have a bearing if the qowc is inconsistent with the communication descriptor for the level in which the answer falls
 if for example a history response displays mid level criteria but fits the level qowc descriptors it will require a move down within the level

 no mark for fall in if explanation is mark scheme question c i answer explain how the corn exchange in newbury could calculate its unit labour cost
 this would then be divided by the number of people using the cinema comment on the implications for a cinema of an increase in its unit labour cost
 if demand is very inelastic then price might increase but not by a higher percentage than the fall in customers
 other cinemas might have the same increase in unit labour costs eg increase in affecting all employers and therefore competitive situation remains same
 question d mark scheme answer using information in the case study discuss the extent to which the cinema industry can be described as contestable
 there are clear financial barriers such as set up costs to entering the market and it is unlikely that all of this could be recouped on exit
 candidates might also point out that firms in the cinema industry earn supernormal profit but do not seem to attract hit and run behaviour
 new firm might buy out an existing complex or chain of complexes rather than set up in competition with new buildings etc
 that the market is an oligopoly can however be rewarded for three marks at least one point must be well analysed and another point analysed at a basic level
 mark june guidance question a mark scheme answer june marks analyse using a diagram the impact of a monopsonist employer on the labour market from which it recruits
 in order to show knowledge and understanding candidates should explain that a monopsonist employer is a situation where a single buyer operates in a labour market
 as the only employer in the market it is faced by the supply curve of the whole industry and can choose any point on the supply curve
 the employer is still constrained by the supply curve in that if it wants to employ more labour it will have to increase the wage in order to increase the supply
 content no diagram maximum level good analysis might include an explanation why the is above the or why the employer chooses to employ at the level where or the impact of elasticity of demand
 in this case an answer which makes assertions about the impact of a monopsonist employer on the labour market without going on to provide analysis
 marks two or more factors identified and applied marks one impact identified and applied level knowledge and understanding of what is meant by a monopsonist employer and a labour market
 in order to attract workers the monopsonist has to offer a wage of the impact of monopsony power is therefore to lower both wages and employment levels compared to the free market equilibrium level
 guidance levels of response question b mark scheme answer june marks discuss the extent to which government intervention is the best method of reducing the labour market failure caused by a monopsonist employer
 market failure occurs as the wage in a labour market controlled by a monopsonist will be lower than the market equilibrium and the level of employment will also be lower
 thus the market has not been left to the free market forces of supply and demand and the presence of market power on the demand side has not resulted in an efficient allocation of resources
 candidates might choose to analyse interventions such as the introduction of a minimum wage either on a national regional or sectoral basis
 an alternative might be to attack the demand side of the labour market and encourage competition for labour through deregulation and competition in the provision of say health care
 in the case of a minimum wage there might be problems in terms of setting the appropriate level and there are difficulties between labour markets in introducing sectoral minimum wages
 discussion which is predominantly to score a mark of candidates must have offered valid economic analysis upon which the discussion is based
 if this economic analysis is not provided then the attempted discussion is no more than unexplained assertion and therefore scores a maximum level mark
 guidance levels of response level discussion that includes a judgement of the extent to which government intervention might reduce market failure caused by a monopsonist employer
 level for a balanced discussion of the extent to which government intervention might reduce market failure caused by a monopsonist employer or two sided on alternative methods of solving problem of market failure
 discussion lacking balance should receive no more than level analysis of how government intervention might reduce market failure caused by a monopsonist employer
 question mark scheme answer june marks content when considering alternatives to government intervention candidates might turn to the supply side and consider the role of trade unions
 there is plenty of scope for analysis here using diagrams and leading on to comments about the relative bargaining strength of the two sides
 some candidates might suggest that governments could intervene to give trade unions greater power or fewer constraints and then proceed to a bilateral monopoly argument
 question a mark scheme answer june marks analyse using diagrams how changes in marginal revenue product explain the quantity of labour that will be employed
 expect candidates to also introduce the concept of derived demand realising that the demand for labour only exists because of the demand for the final product
 for labour is the change in a revenue resulting from employing one more worker and is found by multiplying the marginal physical product by the marginal revenue or price
 workers will be employed up to the point where is equal to the wage when is less than the wage then in theory the worker will not be employed
 in this case an answer which makes assertions about the impact of a on the level of labour employed without going on to provide analysis
 marks two or more factors identified and applied marks one impact identified and applied level knowledge and understanding of what is meant by marginal revenue product
 guidance levels of response question b mark scheme answer june marks discuss the extent to which demand side factors alone explain wage differentials in labour markets
 it is most likely that candidates will take their analysis from forward and concentrate on how wage differentials are related to theory
 candidates should discuss the relative importance of demand and supply factors in different labour markets to obtain the top element of level focus must be on wage differentials throughout the answer and not simply on wage determination
 discussion which is predominantly to score a mark of candidates must have offered valid economic analysis upon which the discussion is based
 if this economic analysis is not provided then the attempted discussion is no more than unexplained assertion and therefore scores a maximum level mark
 discrimination is usually a demand side factor based on perceived and actual guidance levels of response level discussion which includes a judgement of the extent to which wage differentials are determined by demand side factors alone
 level application of knowledge and understanding of demand side factors level knowledge of demand side factors or wage differentials quality of written communication is assessed in this question
 question mark scheme answer marks analyse the main causes of poverty in the candidates might distinguish between absolute and relative poverty
 this will show only knowledge and understanding of poverty unless of course it forms a part of an analysis which focuses on the causes of poverty
 june content a the reasons underlying poverty might include long term unemployment lack of education and training low wages discrimination sickness and disability old age single parent reluctance to claim benefit and poverty traps
 in terms of causes candidates are expected to provide a significant degree of depth and detail in order to achieve good analysis
 for instance unemployment may be a significant cause of poverty due to households having no income from employment and relying on benefits only
 good analysis might then focus on the significance of the duration of unemployment and the wages received if and when in employment affecting the ability to save
 household where the major income earner can be classed as long term unemployed and has a history of no or only low wage employment would be highly susceptible to poverty
 analysis might also consider whether the benefit system is robust enough to prevent unemployed people being classed as accept reasons and analysis which focus on poverty
 if candidates analyse relative poverty then causes might be more concerned with factors which generate inequality of income and wealth e
 in this case an answer which makes assertions about the causes of poverty without going on to provide analysis
 this would not only increase the level of after taxation income but also provide an increased incentive to work
 on the benefit side an increase in the level availability and information provision of state benefits would help to boost household income
 combination of both tax and welfare reform could therefore significantly help in reducing poverty in the through the income and incentive effects on the tax side
 any impact of tax reform will mostly apply to those in employment and thus the policy might be ineffective if long term unemployment is the main cause of poverty
 connected to this is the argument that incentives to work will only become significant if the demand for labour exists incentives might have little impact in times of recession or in cases of unskilled labour
 discussion which is predominantly to score a mark of candidates must have offered valid economic analysis upon which the discussion is based
 level for a balanced discussion of the extent to which reform of tax and benefit system could be used to reduce poverty in the or two sided on alternative methods of solving problem of poverty
 discussion lacking balance should receive no more than level analysis of how tax and benefit system could be used to reduce poverty in the also could be analysis of alternatives to tax and benefit system

 for all parts of each response your first task is to match the response to the appropriate level of response according to the generic levels of response given below
 the list will not be exhaustive and where a candidate offers a response which is not listed examiners will be expected to use their knowledge and discretion as to whether the response is valid

 it does not comprise a set of rules in the way that some other religions have but is recommended because it has been found to be helpful
 as it helps one to see the world as it really is it can for some lead to the noble eightfold path deals with different aspects of life ethics intention meditation and effort
 it also provides practical advice on how to carry out and develop metta these are qualities that help an individual to attain enlightenment and also which make the world a better place for everybody
 finally the noble eightfold path provides a model against which a buddhist can measure their progress and consider what else they could do in order to help themselves towards enlightenment
 having said all of this the buddha himself said that the importance of the noble eightfold path and the dhamma in general is contingent
 if a person does not find it helpful to follow the noble eightfold path or if they find something that is more useful to them then they should discard it
 june mark guidance valid way of approaching this question is to include individual elements of the noble eightfold path and to explain the importance of these individually
 candidates might consider some of the buddhists would obviously disagree with this statement since the main aim of buddhism is to reach enlightenment
 they might claim that there is good evidence for enlightenment as the buddha achieved it during his lifetime and was able to describe it to a and give advice to others as to how to reach it
 they might claim that while it is difficult to prove the existence of life after death since by definition living has experienced it enlightenment is different since it can be gained whilst one is still living
 since enlightenment can be defined as the state of experiencing the world as it truly is free from delusion there is nothing inherently unlikely about being able to achieve it
 it does not for example require belief in a supernatural power or agency whose existence is a matter of faith rather than fact
 although the understanding of it varies somewhat hinduism jainism and sikhism also believe that some form of enlightenment is the ultimate goal of human experience
 the fact that an experience of this sort appears to be a fairly common aspect of human experience suggests that it is real
 some religions or at least groups within them the abrahamic might argue that there is no such thing as enlightenment since it directly contradicts their own beliefs particularly beliefs about life after death
 some people including many atheists would suggest that the experience of enlightenment is a delusion that is caused by religious hysteria or by the human brain
 it could be argued however that the experience is real regardless of its origin or cause and that many buddhists do not claim a supernatural or metaphysical explanation
 june mark guidance it is a valid interpretation of this question to explore the different possible meanings of the term mark scheme question answer june mark spelling punctuation and grammar are assessed using the separate marking grid
 the buddha is one of the three refuges on which buddhism is based and because of this wesak is of great importance to many buddhists
 many buddhists undertake the eight precepts during festivals and believe that this enhances their spiritual progress as it lessens their attachment to the material contingent world
 acts of are also encouraged during festivals such as wesak and this also makes it easier for individuals to achieve enlightenment
 some schools of buddhism believe that the merit generated through such acts can be passed on to help others or even the whole world
 for many buddhists wesak is the main festival and it provides an opportunity to spend time with the family and the community
 candidates might consider some of the the rain retreat was established by the buddha and so could be argued to be essential as it comes directly from the founder
 the rain retreat is held during the rainy season in india and was begun due to the practical difficulties of travelling during this time and because of ethical considerations
 monks travelling at this time might harm the many small creatures that become abundant during the rain or inadvertently harm delicate growing crops
 during the three months of the rain retreat monks are expected to stay close to their temples and to use the opportunity for intensive meditation and study
 it was because monks returned to observe the rain retreat in the same location year after year that settled communities of monks sprang up and many of the early viharas were established
 this suggests that the retreat was important in the formation of buddhism as it exists today but some might argue that as the viharas and monastic communities are now firmly established the importance is diminished
 modern methods of transportation and better roads mean that the practical difficulties of moving around during the monsoon are now greatly reduced thus removing the main reason for holding the retreat
 this would suggest that the rain retreat is of no value in much of the buddhist world and indeed it is not observed world wide
 june mark spag guidance question mark scheme answer june mark responses might of enemies who has conquered greed hatred and who has attained mark for response
 responses might they are necessary in order to reach enlightenment they are a part of the bodhisattva path they are virtues that should be developed by all buddhists examples of or information about the particular paramitas may be given
 these dana sila ksanti virya dhyana and prajna credit may be given where candidates use different english terminology but correctly understand the point of the paramitas
 guidance candidates are likely to relate the term to theravada buddhism but are not required to do so in order to gain the mark as the question merely asks for a definition of the term
 for this reason groups such as the known as triratna have sought to discard what they see as purely cultural and irrelevant aspects of buddhism and adapt its core teachings to life in modern western society
 they would argue that one of the key strengths of buddhism is the way it has constantly adapted to different cultures and ages
 they argue that monastic communities are not realistic in western society and emphasise rather the importance of living out the teachings of the buddha within the family and the community
 triratna buddhists have tended to place particular emphasis on the idea of right livelihood and have set up a number of ethical businesses and collectives aimed at promoting ethical trade and business within the community
 mark candidates might consider some of the theravada is the oldest buddhist school and the one which many would argue is derived from the teachings of the historical buddha without addition or interpretation
 theravada buddhism is not concerned with metaphysics or deities and for many is closer to the true philosophy of the buddha
 many would argue that the mahayana traditions represent a corruption of the true message of buddhism and the over complication of the religion through mythology and superstition
 mahayana scriptures are generally believed to be later than the pali canon and many theravada buddhists would claim that they are not authentic or authoritative
 furthermore the buddha himself said that his teachings should be judged on the basis of their efficacy and that if mahayana teachings can be shown to work they should be adopted
 mahayana means the and is so called because its teachings are often seen to provide an easier route to enlightenment available to all whether members of the sangha or not
 since more people can potentially escape from samsara through mahayana than theravada buddhism many would claim that it represents the tradition
 buddhist teaching and practice has been adapted over the centuries to fit into many new cultures from zen and pureland in japan to triratna in the west
 many followers of these traditions would argue that theravada buddhism is too closely tied to the culture of ancient india and so prevents legitimate development

 mark schemes are prepared by the principal examiner and considered together with the relevant questions by a panel of subject teachers
 this mark scheme includes any amendments made at the standardisation meeting attended by all examiners and is the scheme which was used by them in this examination
 the standardisation meeting ensures that the mark scheme covers the responses to questions and that every examiner understands and applies it in the same correct way
 as preparation for the standardisation meeting each examiner analyses a number of alternative answers not already covered by the mark scheme are discussed at the meeting and legislated for
 if after this meeting examiners encounter unusual answers which have not been discussed at the meeting they are required to refer these to the principal examiner
 it must be stressed that a mark scheme is a working document in many cases further developed and expanded on the basis of reactions to a particular paper
 assumptions about future mark schemes on the basis of one document should be whilst the guiding principles of assessment remain constant details will change depending on the content of a particular examination paper
 verbal answers the basic principle of assessment is that candidates should gain credit for what they know understand and can do
 however these aspects are an integral part of assessing communication and marks cannot be awarded where errors in spelling punctuation or grammar lead to a failure to communicate the required information without ambiguity

 source evaluation is reasonably full and appropriate but lacks completeness on the issues raised by the sources in the light of the question
 source evaluation is partial and it is likely that the provenance itself is not compared may be undeveloped or merely commented on discretely
 identifies some comparative points but is very sequential and perhaps implicit comment on the sources is basic general undeveloped or juxtaposed often through poorly understood quotation
 aos level level mark scheme june and b comparison is minimal and basic with very limited links to the key issue

 level level june and b as part of an historical enquiry analyse and evaluate a range of appropriate source material with discrimination

 convincing analysis and argument with developed explanation leading to careful supported and persuasive judgement arising from a consideration of both content and provenance
 good attempt at focused analysis argument and explanation leading to a supported judgement that is based on the use of most of the content and provenance
 aos level level mark scheme june and b mainly sound analysis argument and explanation but there may be some description and unevenness
 is aware of some of the limitations of the sources individually or as a group but mostly uses them for reference and to illustrate an argument rather than analysing and evaluating them as evidence
 the common sense of purpose in could be seen to be revealed in source even if not in quite the way source meant it
 he had served as a knight under william before being ordained and becoming a royal chaplain and he was also closely associated with odo of bayeux
 orderic vitalis had more understanding of the situation in england and although he used william de poitiers as a source and admired his scholarship he was hostile to odo sympathising with the downtrodden english
 the first sentences of source are not necessarily contradicted by source and the context of the late and may explain william of views on the behaviour of the regents
 question mark scheme answer the sources contain references to different interpretations so they may be grouped according to their view
 source shows how william sought to wrest control of normandy from his brother with money troops and other methods and implies it was a successful attempt
 similarly source shows that in the end robert gave up normandy to go on the first crusade and so william had no further need to worry
 source shows that william attempts at wresting control with the help of nobles who faced loss from the warfare had some success at least until henry intervened
 successful answers will need to make use of all five sources testing them against contextual evidence and evaluating their strengths and weaknesses any limitations as evidence
 sources and could be used to demonstrate that william attempts at ruling both were successful but that william given the division of territory in had less success in normandy where he faced the problem of his ducal elder brother
 contextual knowledge could be used to argue that william as duke of normandy and king of england divided his time reasonably between his territories and was able to reduce rebellion in each with relative ease
 william faced a more serious situation because of the way the conqueror divided his possessions and in the end the situation was only brought to a conclusion by the departure of robert
 the financial exactions which resulted were another issue and candidates may be familiar with the example of william calling up the militia and then sending them home after relieving them of the money they had brought for their expenses
 with regard to provenance candidates might suggest that the critics of the norman kings are guilty of some extravagance of language with both sources and referring to england and normandy groaning under the strain of the conflict
 source is also eager to suggest that men of sound understanding prevailed recognising that civil war benefited and that william was probably the better bet given his undisputed control of england
 he certainly provides much detail on the attempt by william to wrest control of normandy from robert and gives cautious approval to that in his handling of the maine mediation
 henry of huntingdon in source is in a position to take a broader perspective once the outcome of the problem was an effective solution
 it is therefore likely that candidates will conclude that there were moments of difficulty which caused some challenges to the first two norman kings particularly william but that they emerged successful in the end partly through some good fortune
 it should be borne in mind that sources and were all written later in the reign of henry undisputedly ruler of both territories who had imprisoned his eldest brother robert in cardiff castle
 reading between the lines in sources and william clearly had great difficulty before the crusade in ousting his brother from normandy
 knowledge might be used to explain that this referred to thomas cromwell and richard rich named in the pontefract articles of the following yorkshire phase of the same rebellion the pilgrimage of grace
 in source henry claims that parliament had passed the dissolution act of so the common people had no right to challenge this
 he dismisses their complaint about the statute of uses as none of their affair as it has been passed by the landed classes whom it concerns
 knowledge might be used to point out that cromwell had contrived immoral charges against monasteries and taken years to make the commons accept the statute of uses which had caused heated debate
 the differences are that inflation provides the context of both sources but while source emphasises government attempts to deal with high prices and rents source dismisses attempts to cancel a tax justified by the costs of defence
 in contrast somerset in source protests on behalf of edward that parliament though not presently in session would reduce rents in future
 thus the government response in source is more conciliatory than henry in source perhaps because it is protectorship that is in the firing line rather than monarchy
 question mark scheme answer source henry is more indignant calling the rebels and at their likewise source also at rebel boldness
 source is very disparaging calling the lincolnshire rebels common people of the most brutish and beastly county of the whole while source complains of the rebels and despite concessions already made
 the main difference in approach is that henry uses very emotive language and stands firm while somerset offers concessions
 candidates may refer to the utility of both in establishing a similar government response temerity of the value of lying in a monarchical response the value of lying in the more uncertain government of a minor
 sources and might be used to support the interpretation but may also be used to support religious and political causes by with sources and weaker answers may lapse into general information about individual rebellions
 source gives the strongest evidence for the importance of social and economic causes as it focuses on food and wool prices enclosures and rents
 source states that the western rebels complain of shortages of food and goods and sources and mention complaints about tax food shortages and a lack of poor relief though henry denies that the dissolution was responsible
 that somerset had reformed other it might be argued that his attempt to appear humanitarian had caused further economic problems and that his commissions had encouraged enclosure riots
 these sources suggest social causes such as the sense that successful answers will need to make use of all five sources testing them against contextual knowledge and evaluating their strengths and weaknesses any limitations as evidence
 mark scheme question answer june marks guidance feet wished to rule the in source common people criticising their source suggests that class tensions had caused the rebels to authority upon and present petitions
 knowledge of grievances against landlords and ministers might be used to extend these sources in context of the rebels in these three sources being common people unlike and although has some legal and gentry input
 supported overall judgement is required on the extent to which however sources and emphasise religious causes as strongly as social and economic ones
 there is a sense that edward himself is the author of source rather than somerset as indicated in the introduction as it insists that he fully supports protestant changes
 both rebellions in and had local social and economic causes as well as religious and it had been the clergy who had drawn up their petition of grievances in both cases an important evaluative point
 simon renard may be unreliable in stating in source that the main cause of rebellion was religion rather than the spanish marriage as he is writing to the emperor who will not wish his marriage plans to be undermined
 xenophobia and foreign involvement played a part in causing this rebellion as in that of the northern earls in source purpose here is to plead his cause and spread the blame
 question mark scheme answer june marks religion is stated as the main cause of the rebellion though there are political causes concerning failure to name an heir and a proposed marriage between mary queen of scots and norfolk
 politics and religion might be seen as intertwined in sources and factional rivalry and criticism of ministers are hinted at in and and provide the context for all these sources
 this may suggest that religious issues were just a screen for political rebellion it depends how candidates interpret the evidence
 in both the king seems reluctant to accept the newcastle propositions sent to him by parliament and in source only those offered by the scots
 knowledge of these might be used to evaluate the response in source in source the king is unwilling to negotiate and hopes to delay his reply for his own benefit
 the date of source confirms that he did so as it records his third answer to propositions more than ten months later
 in source the king is unwilling to accept a presbyterian settlement offered by the scots or parliament fearing loss of conscience crown and honour
 in source he is only willing to accept a presbyterian settlement with significant conditions which would severely limit religious change
 it might be inferred that as this is his third reply his two earlier answers had been less and he had been buying time
 in source the king states that the scots wished him to accept a presbyterian settlement clip the and shows his unwillingness to lose his royal power
 thus in source his apparent willingness to accept a presbyterian church government for three years seems hypocritical and contradicts his comment in source that a presbyterian settlement went against his conscience
 this difference is also reflected in his desire to keep some control over the form of church settlement will add some of his to consider the resulting religious despite ratifying the westminster assembly
 he will also hand over the militia for ten years but desires control june marks guidance comparison of two sources
 thus in evaluation of content source would seem to be less reliable as acceptance of the propositions run contrary to his deeply held beliefs about church and state
 source is a private letter to his wife in which the king confides his negative feelings about the proposals for a settlement by scots and parliament
 in contrast source is his official answer read out in the house of commons tailored to an audience of mps to try and retain as much power as he can while appearing to make concessions
 thus source has his true feelings towards a settlement and source represents his considered offer with the purpose of retaining his power and position
 the context of source is his confinement by the scots whereas source is published after the scots have handed him over to parliament in january and parliament had become disenchanted with an increasingly restless new model army
 charles is back in the mainstream of settlement proposals in source and might be seen to be playing his divided enemies off against each other
 sources and are useful to support the interpretation that divisions among the opponents were the main reason whereas sources and are useful for a counter argument that the untrustworthiness of the king was to blame
 sources and support the interpretation that divisions among the scots alluded to by the king in source june and between agitators and independents in the new model army hindered negotiations with the king
 successful answers will need to make use of all five sources testing them against contextual knowledge and evaluating their strengths and weaknesses any limitations as evidence
 source also reports the capture of parliament and although source reports support and pity for the king it also condemns his so seems to adopt a more approach perhaps because the author is an outsider writing from edinburgh
 in contrast sources and to an extent and might be to support the that the king was to blame for the failure of negotiations during these years
 source suggests that the king in a private letter to his wife revealed his true negativity towards the proposals on offer
 he feared loss of his power conscience and honour if he should accept either the scottish or london propositions for a settlement
 however with source reveals acceptance of key aspects with significant exceptions and conditions in his third public reply to propositions
 his suggestion that the king felt his views were still powerful enough to june marks guidance addressed in focusing upon the terms of the question but no set conclusion is expected
 knowledge of personality might be used to support the charge of in source or manipulation in context of divisions between the presbyterians the army and the city of london
 source is a reasonable representation of the answer whereas source might be seen as less reliable than sources and it not only reports hearsay but in memoirs written during charles reign long after the event
 particularly its report on cromwell might be exaggerated with the purpose of exonerating the king from criticism for not accepting a settlement
 all the sources represent partisan views although is from one of the parties expressing its private views which may suggest the king as the main obstacle to a settlement

 where some judgement is required mark schemes will provide the principles by which marks will be awarded and exemplification may be limited
 when examiners are in doubt regarding the application of the mark scheme to a response the team leader must be consulted
 history marking guidance marking of levels of response the mark scheme provides an indication of the sorts of answer that might be found at different levels
 it is intended as a guide and it will be necessary therefore for examiners to use their professional judgement in deciding both at which level a question has been answered and how effectively points have been sustained
 candidates should always be rewarded according to the quality of thought expressed in their answer and not solely according to the amount of knowledge conveyed
 however candidates with only a superficial knowledge will be unable to develop or sustain points sufficiently to move to higher levels
 at the end of each answer examiners should look back on the answer as a whole in the light of these general criteria in order to ensure that the total mark reflects their overall impression of the worth
 deciding on the mark point within a level the first stage is to decide the overall level and then whether the work represents high mid or low performance within the level
 one stronger passage at level would not by itself merit a level award but it would be evidence to support a high level award unless there were also substantial weaknesses in other areas
 assessing quality of written communication qowc will have a bearing if the qowc is inconsistent with the communication descriptor for the level in which the answer falls
 if for example a history response displays mid level criteria but fits the level qowc descriptors it will require a move down within the level
 generic level descriptors part as part of an historical enquiry analyse and evaluate a range of appropriate source material with discrimination
 sources are used as evidence with some consideration of their attributes such as the nature origins purpose or audience with some consideration of how this can affect the weight given to the evidence
 in addressing there is a clear attempt to use the sources in combination but this may be imbalanced in terms of the issues addressed or in terms of the use of the sources
 the attributes of the source are taken into account in order to establish what weight the content they will bear in relation to the specific enquiry
 analyse and evaluate in relation to the historical context how aspects of the past have been interpreted and represented in different ways
 these will be supported by limited factual material which has some accuracy and relevance although not directed analytically at the focus of the the material will be mostly generalised
 they may however include material which is either descriptive and thus only implicitly relevant to the focus or which strays from that focus
 candidates offer an analytical response which relates well to the focus of the question and which shows some understanding of the key issues contained in it
 there will be some integration of contextual knowledge with material drawn from sources although this may not be sustained throughout the response
 the candidate will demonstrate the skills needed to produce convincing extended writing but there may be passages which lack clarity or coherence
 comprehends the sources and selects from them in order to identify points which support or differ from the representation contained in the question
 when supporting the decision made in relation to the question the sources will be used in the form of a summary of their information
 in addressing the specific enquiry there is clear awareness that a representation is under discussion and there is evidence of reasoning from the evidence of both sources although there may be some lack of balance
 assessment grid question and b number marks or total marks weighting marks marks total marks for question note on descriptors relating to communication each level descriptor above concludes with a statement about written communication
 thus most candidates whose historical understanding related to a given question suggests that they should sit in a particular level will express that understanding in ways which broadly conform to the communication descriptor appropriate to that level
 indicators of written communication are best considered normatively and may be used to help decide a specific mark to be awarded within a level
 quality of written communication which fails to conform to the descriptor for the level will depress the award of marks by a within the level
 in that case quality of written communication will raise the mark by a britain representation and reform question number indicative content mark the sources offer evidence to both support and challenge the claim in the question
 source and source are in agreement that the liberal organisation is more effective than that of the conservative party and candidates are expected to refer to this distinction between the political parties
 source implies that it is unlikely that the conservatives would be able to do this because representative associations are not at all favoured by this difference in emphasis is likely to be explained by reference to the provenance
 they may comment on the location of both sources source is the for newcastle and source makes this speech in any sensible suggestion along these lines should be credited
 developed responses based on these arguments can reach at candidates will both support and challenge the stated claim using evidence from different sources interpreted in context
 candidates are likely to begin by an examination of source and source which offer support for the given view that popular pressure played an important role in the passage of the reform act
 source outlines the range of different types of popular pressure that were in operation in the period source offers an example of a specific meeting
 better responses will be able to develop these examples as occurring at different points in the crisis and with different specific aims or causes e
 riots such as that in bristol october which were a response to the rejection of the second reading of the bill or the days of may which aimed to stop wellington forming a government
 candidates are likely to pick up on the line of argument in source that such popular pressure meant that of parliament was needed to avoid and might consider whether popular pressure amounted to this
 whilst source suggests that the threat was source could be used to counter this line of argument in view of the of its this should not however be the dominant theme of the response
 the best responses may very well consider the interaction of different factors to explain the apparent conflict and offer an overall judgement
 the best answers will be able to reflect on the distinction both between long and short term success and between the impact on working class political consciousness and changes to the political system
 there are a number of routes by which this question could be tackled and all relevant approaches should be appropriately credited
 candidates could develop this point by reference to source comments that these men however poor wanted to discuss the doctrine of political and elaborate further using contextual knowledge
 although it was written by an he clearly does not see these long term links between chartism and later movements when he compares the working men of only thirty years later to the chartists
 candidates should explore these alternative arguments and reach a supported judgement incorporating contextual knowledge to help them reach a valid conclusion
 the best responses may very well consider the interaction of different factors to explain the apparent conflict and offer an overall judgement
 poverty public health and the growth of government in britain question number indicative content mark the sources offer evidence to both support and challenge the claim in the question
 source and source are both agreed on an alternative obstacle to improvement an attachment to laissez faire principles and opposition to any greater intervention
 source in a parliamentary debate makes it clear that this did not approve of greater this is supported by source which does not want which can be read as government intervention
 candidates may well draw a conclusion about whether cost or opposition to intervention is more significant and this should be rewarded accordingly
 conflicting responsibilities municipal authorities source pipe repairs outside and inside vested interests lack of knowledge it is unlikely that candidates will consider all of these possibilities in the time available to them
 developed responses based on these arguments can reach at candidates will both support and challenge the stated claim using evidence from different sources interpreted in context
 at they will use the sources interpreted in context as a set to reach a reasoned judgement about the extent to which the main obstacle to public health reform in the was the costs involved
 number indicative content mark the focus of the question is an examination of the factors that drove the opposition to the new poor law
 candidates might use their contextual knowledge to show how opposition was linked to the onset of the new poor law in a particular region
 candidates are likely to begin by an examination of the arguments in source and source which offer support to the view outlined in the question
 they lost their to a basic level of the deserving poor feared who they might be in the workhouse with and there were rumours about what went on in the workhouse
 this latter point in particular might well be supported by reference to contextual knowledge such as the book of murder
 candidates may wish to consider the weight that can be put on this argument in light of its attribution
 it suggests that there was a tradition of radical action in the north and that this combined with tory opposition to produce concerted action
 candidates might use their contextual knowledge to discuss how this impacted on opposition in both the north and the south
 the best responses may very well consider the interaction of different factors to explain the apparent conflict and offer an overall judgement
 source supports the view in the question by suggesting that the key factor in improvement was the civil engineering work of bazalgette in developing a sewerage system
 source suggests that bazalgette and his work was more important than any other person but source offers an alternative view and points to the importance of the work done by john simon
 it is anticipated that candidates will use their contextual knowledge to elaborate on the points made in this source and weigh their significance against that of bazalgette and the creation of a sewerage system
 this again would contradict the line of argument presented in source candidates are unlikely to address all of these issues in depth in the time available
 the best responses may very well consider the interaction of different factors to explain the apparent conflict and offer an overall judgement

 why have human rights become more important in global indicative content human rights are rights to which people are entitled by virtue of being human
 human rights are universal in the sense that they supposedly belong to all humans rather than to members of any particular country religion race gender or other group
 human rights abuses have been used as a justification for controversial interventionism in recent years and debate over when and when not to intervene
 in particular it draws attention to the way in which aid debt and the practices of tncs help to perpetuate inequality between the industrialised north and the predominantly rural south
 some question the relevance of the term by drawing attention to the growing influence of the south or at least certain members of it and to significant divides within the south and even within the north
 indicative content the task of dealing with climate change is notoriously difficult and there is controversy over how best to tackle climate change
 adaptation strategies include relocation of settlements in areas at risk from climate change such as coastal regions improved sea walls and improved land management
 horizontal proliferation since the end of the cold war suggests that the nuclear treaty is failing and that the bipolar balance based on mutual assured destruction has broken down
 this includes terrorist groups and states with what are perceived to be dictatorial governments involved in regional rivalries the chances of nuclear weapons being used increases as more states have them
 intervention tends to require support from the major powers it is generally accepted that the united nations security council is the most appropriate body for the authorisation of intervention
 chances of success may limit involvement in areas such as tibet and chechnya and the extent to which the major powers are already committed in areas such as iraq and afghanistan can reduce likelihood of intervention elsewhere
 indicative content participation in an open and globalised economy can be argued to bring a number of benefits including growing prosperity and a reduction or removal of poverty
 the argument in support of the statement could include the an open and globalised economy stimulates all economies including those of developing countries because it brings increased entrepreneurialism inward investment improved technology and access to foreign markets
 developments in the global south suggest that many societies have benefited from an engagement with an open and globalised economy notably examples include the asian economies and the dramatic economic emergence of china and india
 in such cases increased growth and prosperity has been closely associated with taking advantage of export opportunities and inward investments that have been provided by globalisation
 on the other hand countries like north korea that have remained outside the global economy have suffered from widespread poverty and low growth
 these include the globalisation is based on structural inequalities and injustices notably ones in developed states exploit dependent states that are essentially used toproduce primary goods
 achieving concerted global action on climate change is complicated since the tradition within international relations is centred around concepts of state sovereignty and the belief that states pursue their national interest
 moreover global environmental problems tend not to be caused by deliberate acts of national policy but instead are the unintended of broader processes
 non state actors such as firms are at least as important as states in that their activities will lead to environmental damage
 environmental pessimists argue that humans are causing global warming particularly in the developed world and that states are failing to as is required in order to tackle this issue
 they argue that only very limited progress has been made in the key global conferences such as kyoto and copenhagen and that agreements are inadequate
 there are some signs of progress which provide a greater deal of environmental optimists believe that there are signs that states are recognising the need for clear and concerted action to deal with environmental issues
 climate change has dominated the international agenda since the there is now a consensus that climate change is happening and a framework for cooperation has been developing through new institutions and conferences
 concern over the impact of climate change has reached a level where states are more willing than ever to cooperate

 for question airfix firm making model kits in a competitive market airfix is a firm supplying plastic model kits of planes vehicles and ships to customers who make and paint them
 percentage of sales this change in demand for model kits has been caused by an increase in the number of substitutes available to those and such as games and social media
 however the airfix brand has also become more attractive to those over as a result of advertising and television programmes such as james where the presenter built a full scale model of a world war spitfire plane
 he estimated that in the recent recession despite average incomes falling by the demand for lower priced kits fell by only he also believes that the demand for these kits is price elastic
 airfix has seen the cost of producing its kits reduce significantly as manufacturing has moved from the to china and the production process has become more efficient due to advances in technology
 despite this airfix can only produce a limited number of different kits and therefore it has had to make choices over which planes and other models it will produce in any year
 there are various policy measures available to the chinese government to internalise the negative externalities and currently it is examining the likely impact of imposing a pollution tax
 the success of the programme presented by james may and the move of production to china have each had an effect on the market equilibrium for airfix spitfire model kits
 other than a change in taste and fashion state and explain how two determinants of demand might shift the demand curve for airfix model kits
 turn over given the marketing figures as to how the demand for model kits was affected by the calculate the income elasticity of demand for the lower priced model kits
 the marketing director believes that the demand for low priced model kits is comment on how a knowledge of price elasticity of demand would be helpful when making business decisions

 inaccurate reading or use of inaccurate meaning is unclear supports interpretation in conjunction with if this relates to amended challenges interpretation in conjunction with if this relates to amended amended interpretation uses knowledge to provide context to interpret source
 evaluates evidence from sources in their historical makes inferences from the sources makes an informed use of the provenance of the sources or crossreferences the sources to reach a supported conclusion
 uses evidence inferred from the sources to test the interpretation by showing either how they support it or disagree with it
 candidates will explain both the value and the problems associated with using these sources even if one side of the explanation is stronger than the other
 evidence from the sources that can support the interpretation source describes norway as a mountainous inhospitable land with limited space for settlement and agriculture
 similarly source describes jutland as a and fit for human in the story in source a significant push factor is the attitude of the king towards the family
 in source although jutland is described as sterile other parts of denmark are clearly much wealthier with and much source shows some of the factors at work
 vikings are attracted to lindisfarne because it is wealthy and took and because they meet little resistance from such an isolated religious community
 recent writers have paid more attention to this issue of pressure on the vikings from outside and have suggested that expansion at first was for defence or in revenge for raids against them
 source shows that vikings were motivated by opportunism and perceived weaknesses of their enemies rather than any problems at home
 the factor of land for settlement can be seen in both sources and marks june guidance reward grouping of sources at level sources and all support the reward of the content of sources at level and above
 to reach in candidates must either evaluate a source using its provenance or undertake genuine by using one source to interpret or evaluate another
 question mark scheme answer the description of denmark in source is from an outsider of it is unclear where he got his information from as he might not have visited the country himself
 source is written by a churchman but he was not present at the events so has reconstructed the account from other sources
 marks june guidance judgements that simply add extra factors to the existing interpretation or make slight changes of degree should be rewarded at level judgement candidates may recognise that the sources show change and continuity over time
 while the factor suggested in the interpretation might have been the initial cause of expansion it is clear from the sources that other factors became important over time
 it is not particularly flattering to the king harald and describes an argument marks guidance in candidates will probably show knowledge and understanding at a level similar to that shown in source evaluation
 marks june guidance the sources as a set reward at the top of the level reached in do not reward those who identify content topics e
 sources would not be useful for a historian who wanted to find out about viking means questions related to concepts e
 candidates need to step back from the sources and look at the more general lines of enquiry that can be followed
 candidates should consider what knowledge of these conquests tells us about why the vikings went abroad and whether they reinforce or contradict the pattern suggested in these sources
 question answer a knowledge and understanding marks candidates should use knowledge of the period to interpret the sources and evaluate the evidence they contain
 evidence from the sources that can support the interpretation source does not refer directly to the revival of the classical past but this can be inferred from desire to discover anything rare or special in the works of others
 source directly refers to a to the imitation of and suggests that although architecture from the classical world survived it had not been a source of inspiration until now
 evidence from the sources that can challenge the interpretation source takes a religious theme as a starting point and marks june guidance rewarded at level and above
 question mark scheme answer then begins to make use of artistic styles that developed from classical architecture perspective vanishing points etc
 in source alberti seems interested in knowledge for its own sake rather than where it came from or what form it took
 interpretation and evaluation of sources an example of is that a good reflection of change and continuity can be seen by comparing the paintings in sources and renaissance v
 other examples may be given to test whether or not the painting in source from a later period of renaissance art is typical of the form or subject of other paintings
 to reach in candidates must either evaluate a source using its provenance or undertake genuine by using one source to interpret or evaluate another
 marks guidance in candidates will probably show knowledge and understanding at a level similar to that shown in source evaluation
 where candidates consider the uses issues and problems of the sources as a set reward at the top of the level reached in this is more than summarising source content
 candidates need to step back from the sources and look at the more general lines of enquiry that can be followed
 marks guidance knowledge and understanding should be rewarded in so far as they support interpretation and evaluation of the sources
 missing source and why this might be an issue the sources omit sculptures and do not focus strongly on architecture across the period
 the evidence from the sources should be placed in the context of developing ideas about nationalism and the nation states of germany and italy
 evidence from the sources that can support the interpretation in source the writer states that the french revolution has awakened ideas of a nation in germany
 source contains some contradictions but does indicate that there are nationalist ideas that could have been developed in the revolutions of and source states that the revolution in palermo has removed the king and moved events on in naples
 source states that the revolution of has moved on the debate about what germany amounts to and how it should be ruled
 interpretation and evaluation of sources sources and are both from the period and candidates may generalise from them about the impact of the french revolution on nationalism
 to reach in candidates must either evaluate a source using its provenance or undertake genuine by using one source to interpret or evaluate another
 b these sources could be used to trace developments in both italy and germany in relation to levels of enthusiasm for unification the roles of individuals the popularity of monarchs etc
 only one good example of each of the following is the purpose of the civil service report could be assessed the writer is clearly concerned by the dominance of prussianism in germany
 this makes it useful in an investigation about why the role of william could be so different from that of his predecessors
 in italy the sense is one of excitement and enthusiasm while in germany there is more practical debate about the scope and constitution of a united germany
 candidates may consider that other factors should be included in the interpretation or that a contrast should be made between germany and italy
 marks guidance knowledge and understanding should be rewarded in so far as they support interpretation and evaluation of the sources
 the typicality of the sentiments described in source may be questioned there is a sense of nationhood here but early nationalist meetings in germany were poorly attended
 question a answer knowledge and understanding candidates will need to deploy knowledge of the powers of the president and the amount of influence they could exert on lawmaking on individual states on the judiciary and on the public
 they will also need to show understanding of their multiple concerns the welfare of all law and order and the international image of the for example
 they will also need some understanding of the context war the jim crow era the deal post of cold war the close election campaign of and the civil rights era of the kennedy assassination
 they will also need to consider the range of ideas about how best to support african americans at different times
 according to source clearly has a view of the question and is aware of the limitations imposed by the constitution on his power
 in source truman is challenging the previously held view that the federal government had limited power to intervene in individual states on civil rights issues
 june where knowledge and understanding take into account change continuity over time this should be rewarded at level and above
 question mark scheme answer source reports how intervened for to obtain his release from prison during the election campaign
 in source truman is taking a first step but it could be argued that he is leaving it up to the committee rather than taking the lead
 in source has become involved but were his motives simply to gain in source points out that everyone must be involved if discrimination is to end
 candidates could consider the purpose of the sources booker is inclined to wait until it is clear that african americans have earned the vote rather than pushing white america so fast that greater hostility results
 to reach in candidates must either evaluate a source using its provenance or undertake genuine by using one source to interpret or evaluate another
 question mark scheme answer may have been more concerned eleanor roosevelt to gain the black vote than to help and contextual knowledge of the slow pace of actions regarding civil rights could confirm this
 they could also show change over time in the methods of african americans sources and and possibly candidates will need to assess a number of issues to access high marks in this answer
 marks guidance in candidates will probably show knowledge and understanding at a level similar to that shown in source evaluation
 the reliability of source might be questioned being the interpretation given by eleanor roosevelt who seemed the fact she had been approached as first lady by the source to be sympathetic to the cause
 the typicality of booker approach in source could be questioned in the light of knowledge of du efforts at a similar time to gain rights through the courts

 in of all cinema sites were multiplex cinemas and their dominance was even greater when considering the number of screens as shown in fig
 number of cinema screens by type of cinema provider one possible reason for the trend towards the multiplex cinema has been the existence of internal economies of scale in the industry
 total labour costs tend not to be as important as in other industries with cinemas employing small numbers of relatively low paid workers
 their major costs come in the shape of fixed costs such as rents rates and the rights to show the latest films
 cinema screens and sites by provider cinema competition in newbury for many years people in newbury who wanted to go to the cinema were forced to travel elsewhere if they wanted to see newly released films
 the large local cinema had closed and for a period the corn exchange was the only place to watch films in newbury
 the corn exchange has a single screen with a fixed capacity of only seats and is unable to show the latest new film releases until later than the main multiplex providers
 the recent opening of a new vue multiplex cinema in newbury did not however cause problems for the corn exchange
 the corn exchange remains price competitive operates a popular loyalty card system and shows a variety of mainstream and minority interest films
 it also has showings dedicated to specific groups such as for and shall go to the for parents and carers with babies under months
 the vue cinema part of a national group has the benefit of being a high capacity multiplex cinema showing the latest film releases as soon as possible and has little local competition for the service it provides
 on a national scale the main challenge to the market dominance of the major multiplex providers might be the growth in the variety of ways in which films are now viewed as shown in fig

 how and why are regionalism and globalisation indicative content is not an exhaustive account of relevant regionalism is the theory or practice of coordinating activities within a geographical region comprising a number of states
 power can be organised and distributed in global politics through great powers superpowers and others in periods of multipolarity bipolarity and unipolarity
 there is a suggestion that it has become a tool of certain states to pursue their own interests and that it may even undermine the united nations
 indicative content is not an exhaustive account of relevant political globalisation refers to the growing importance of international organisations which assert influence within an international area
 economic globalisation refers to the process whereby all national economies have to a greater or lesser extent been absorbed into an interlocking global economy
 political globalisation is often linked to economic globalisation and there are numerous examples of international organisations which can be used as examples of the phenomenon
 indicative content is not an exhaustive account of relevant federalism refers to legal and political structures that distribute power between two distinct levels of government neither of which is subordinate to the other
 the switzerland and canada serve as examples at state level but suggests that the same arrangement is possible at a regional level
 it is well worth considering the extent to which china is mobilizing power globally and the extent to which the term is appropriate in the existing polar system
 international organisations tend to recognise states as the central units of global politics and it is states that meet to make decisions in summits and conferences
 counter argument may focus on the lack of any global alternative to the united nations which is still able to bring the vast majority of states together for diplomacy
 evidence of this transformation can be found in the actions of bodies or bodies affiliated to the united nations such as the international atomic energy agency and the intergovernmental panel on climate change

 responses might the example of jesus the bible priests or other religious leaders papal church saints conscience other christians family mark for each response
 in addition the idea that all suffering will ultimately be redeemed and those who maintain their faith and trust in god will be rewarded might be explored
 another approach might be to consider the omnipotent nature of god and the idea of a divine plan for all lives
 this could be said to mean that god would not inflict greater suffering on people than they are able to bear and this belief might help people to deal with their suffering
 since god is good everything which is a result of will must be for the greater good and this might also give individuals the strength to cope
 discussion might be built around whether badness is an inherent characteristic of an individual or whether it can only be judged in relation to specific incidents or contexts

 responses might scriptures varnashramadharma the law of karma priests gurus or other religious leaders avatars and heroes of the epics saints or holy people other hindus family mark for each response
 june mark guidance candidates might consider some of the many hindus believe that everything is brahman tvam people are separated from brahman by maya and their own ignorance which creates attachments to things of this world
 some candidates might consider that this which creates the cycle of samsara incorporates suffering as an inherent part of attachment so hindus can work to reduce it by cultivating detachment from karma and seeking to be free of maya
 alternatively hindus might look to specific deities both to help them understand their suffering and to pray for that suffering to be relieved or that they will have the strength to cope with it
 candidates might consider examples like ganesha who removes obstacle lakshmi who is a deity of wealth and good fortune kali the goddess of time who liberates people from their bodies or vishnu who stands for justice
 other candidates might focus on the operation of karma which ensures that wrong or harmful actions will have negative consequences and the concept of dharma which every individual should strive to fulfil
 not only will this have an impact on future rebirth and reduce the suffering in them but it also includes the duty to accept the consequences of previous lives
 candidates might consider some of the hindus believe all people contain the potential for both good and evil and if they commit evil actions it is a result of their own weaknesses
 the operation of karma might also be considered actions are rarely considered intrinsically either good or bad in hinduism and an apparently bad action might be the means by which karma is served

 candidates might consider some of the for muslims it is extremely important to remain faithful and obedient to allah regardless of what temptations are placed in the way
 this includes maintaining faith in the face of suffering and candidates are might choose to focus on the concept of testing faith
 suffering evil and temptation to sin can all be said to be allowed for this reason and a muslim might cope with them by remembering this
 allah would also know how much suffering is beyond what a person can endure and a loving god would not inflict suffering beyond this
 there is also the belief that enduring suffering will be rewarded in the afterlife if the sufferer has passed the test of their faith
 candidates might consider some of the muslims believe all people contain the potential for both good and evil since they have free will
 people who do evil are often those who have allowed themselves to be tempted by shaytan but allah is forgiving and people can find the strength to resist and overcome temptation

 other beliefs such as that a loving would not inflict more suffering on a person than they are able to bear might be explored in the same way
 other candidates might consider scriptural stories of the sufferings has allowed the chosen people to endure in their history and the reasons for those sufferings punishments for sin and testing faith for example
 individuals might be encouraged that their sufferings are less than in these examples or might find meaning in the idea that there is a reason for suffering
 they might also take comfort in the fact that suffering is eventually redeemed by some candidates might consider the importance of obedience to and obeying the mitzvoth
 candidates might consider some of the jews believe all people contain the potential for both good and evil since they were given free will as a gift by candidates might argue this means jews would wholly reject the statement

 candidates might consider some of the many candidates might begin by considering the nature of the world as an aspect of individuals are separated from waheguru by maya and haumai which leaves them vulnerable to the five evils
 these are the things which cause suffering and by striving to be gurmukh and detached from maya sikhs are inevitably coping with suffering
 other candidates might argue that suffering can help sikhs to be aware of maya which in turn reminds them of the importance of nam and of maintaining their focus on god even in difficult times
 candidates might consider some of the sikhs believe all people contain the potential for both good and evil since they have free will
 however they might also note that while an individual who is jivan mukht may act only in ways pleasing to god not everyone can achieve this in their current lifetime

 responses might tipataka or named components of it sutta pitaka vinyana pitaka and abdidhamma pitaka the sutras or named examples such as the heart sutra or the lotus sutra the pali canon mark for response
 although the term asked about is two words they refer to a single concept thus responses that repeat either of the term e
 they might argue for example that experiences which seem to reveal a supreme being would be rejected or regarded as a mistake
 another approach might be to consider one form of revelation in greater depth such as scripture considering the different ways in which individuals engage with and understand their faith
 the question asks about different responses to the issue so some candidates might take a more practical approach considering how individuals who have revelatory experiences are treated or regarded in the buddhist community
 candidates might also note that as a person perceived as enlightened has a great deal of influence and a higher status others might regard them with suspicion questioning their motives or sincerity or even suggesting that they are delusional
 question mark scheme answer june mark the origins of buddhism are of course the enlightenment of the buddha achieved while meditating beneath a bodhi tree
 candidates might consider this to be a clear example of revelation and therefore conclude that buddhists would agree with the statement at least in relation to their own faith
 other candidates will go further examining whether this is really an issue or whether elements of both sides could be correct
 although the term asked about is two words they refer to a single concept thus responses that repeat either of the term e
 they might note for example that gifts of the spirit are easily identified and commonly experienced in some churches but that other groups regard them as affectations
 another approach might be to consider one form of religious experience in greater depth such as worship considering the different ways in which individuals engage with and understand their faith
 candidates might look at the different forms which this takes in different churches and how often individuals might partake in order to examine the different response to this form of religious experience
 the question asks about different responses to the issue so some candidates might take a more practical approach considering how individuals who have such experiences are treated or regarded in the christian community
 they could explain that some christians regard such individuals as important guides on their own path while others consider their own relationship with god to be more significant
 candidates are therefore likely to conclude that the statement is true of christianity and since christianity is perceived as the only true faith it must also be a generally true statement
 other candidates will go further examining whether this is really an issue or whether elements of both sides could be correct
 alternatively they might ask whether the experience must be one of revelation to an individual or whether the event is there to serve as a revelation for those prepared to see and accept it a revelation to the world
 responses might the vedas or specific examples such as the rig veda the bhagavad gita the epics the upanishads the puranas specific named examples such as the rig veda the mahabharata or the ramayana mark for response
 although the term asked about is two words they refer to a single concept thus responses that repeat either of the term e
 they might argue for example that for devotees of a particular deity a direct experience of that deity would be of great significance while other hindus focus on the way they experience god through the world and other people
 another approach might be to consider one form of religious experience in greater depth such as worship considering the different ways in which individuals engage with and understand their faith
 candidates might consider the extent to which performing puja constitutes a religious experience or whether meditation or ascetic practices create more powerful or highly regarded experiences
 the question asks about different responses to the issue so some candidates might take a more practical approach considering how individuals who have such experiences are treated or regarded in the hindu community
 candidates might consider the concept of gurus or saints explaining how these individuals are identified and regarded by other hindus
 the origins of hinduism are not known for certain and the multiplicity of hindu scriptures means that there is no universally agreed foundational myth either
 candidates might therefore conclude that hinduism as a faith cannot have begun with an experience of revelation although individuals may choose to become guidance the question is on the reasons for different responses e
 however other candidates might consider the difference between smriti and shruti scriptures as suggestive of a role for revelation in early hinduism
 other candidates will go further examining whether this is really an issue or whether elements of both sides could be correct
 although the term asked about is two words they refer to a single concept thus responses that repeat either of the term e
 they might argue for example that it is more important to demonstrate obedience to allah in daily life and that a personal connection with allah is best achieved through salah
 another approach might be to consider one form of religious experience in greater depth such as worship considering the different ways in which individuals engage with and understand their faith
 muslims recognise different forms of prayer such as the formal salah and the informal dua and candidates might examine how these create religious experiences for the individual
 the question asks about different responses to the issue so some candidates might take a more practical approach considering how individuals who have such experiences are treated or regarded in the muslim community
 miracles are accepted as possible but again they are performed by allah and not the individuals concerned in the event therefore muslims might regard those individuals as particularly fortunate or as irrelevant to what happened
 in addition candidates might consider the line of revelation leading up to the via the prophets islam shares with judaism and christianity to be further evidence for the truth of the statement
 other candidates will go further examining whether this is really an issue or whether elements of both sides could be correct
 although the term asked about is two words they refer to a single concept thus responses that repeat either of the term e
 the question asks about different responses to the issue so some candidates might take a more practical approach considering how individuals who have such experiences are treated or regarded in the jewish community
 adam was not given the torah or all the mitzvot observed by jews today and was given gifts in exchange for the promises he made
 whereas a revelation might be more usually seen as the communication of knowledge or truth from directly to an individual
 other candidates will go further examining whether this is really an issue or whether elements of both sides could be correct
 alternatively they might ask whether the experience must be one of revelation to an individual or whether the event is there to serve as a revelation for those prepared to see and accept it a revelation to the world
 although the term asked about is two words they refer to a single concept thus responses that repeat either of the term e
 responses might having the right to tell someone what to do being in charge of something source of power religious teachings religious leadership mark for response
 they might argue for example that everyone experiences waheguru all the time through the world around them but that sikhs who are jivan mukht have a more direct and profound awareness
 another approach might be to consider one form of religious experience in greater depth such as worship considering the different ways in which individuals engage with and understand their faith
 sikh worship involves nam through which a constant awareness of waheguru is achieved and candidates might examine the different forms of nam and the results of it for individual sikhs in their daily lives
 the question asks about different responses to the issue so some candidates might take a more practical approach considering how individuals who have such experiences are treated or regarded in the sikh community
 candidates might consider the concept of jivan mukht or achieving liberation while still in this lifetime explaining how these individuals are identified and regarded by other sikhs
 they could explain that all sikhs strive to be gurmukh but that there is an element of grace involved in the ultimate achievement of liberation
 some sikhs might regard such individuals as guides or examples to them on their own spiritual path while others consider that everyone has to work for their own liberation
 question mark scheme answer origins lie in the disappearance of guru nanak dev ji and his emergence from the river three days later
 the rules of the khalsa and the contents of the guru granth sahib ji came much later but are still revelatory as they were produced by the gurus who carried the divine light originally given to guru nanak

 some candidates might conclude that this means that buddhists have no opinion on the matter striving to remain detached from debates on the issue and ignoring both scientific and religious opinions
 others might consider that the lack of an ultimate deity in buddhism means that some buddhists cannot believe such a being was responsible for creation and so by default they must accept scientific views such as evolution
 there are also buddhists who maintain beliefs in deity which could influence their views on the origins of humanity
 alternatively candidates might look more deeply at the reasons behind the buddhas refusal to answer the question namely that such considerations do not contribute to escaping dukkha
 candidates might suggest that only those individuals who have already achieved enlightenment or progressed a long way towards it can achieve sufficient detachment to simply leave a question open
 also a refusal to debate is not necessarily the same as having no opinion and candidates might argue that buddhists simply prefer to keep their opinions to themselves since arguing can only increase dissatisfaction and discontent
 some candidates might be familiar with the concept of dependent origination and could use it to explain the buddhist view of the nature of reality
 this view could be seen as in accord with some modern scientific theories and candidates might present it in this way or as a result of pure rational thought on the matter by the buddha
 some candidates might suggest that the idea of cyclical rebirth through a succession of realms is somewhat evolutionary in nature and use this to argue that buddhists are more likely to accept the theory of evolution
 question mark scheme answer since buddhism teaches that considering ultimate questions cannot help reduce dukkha some candidates might conclude that buddhism would reject this statement
 religion and science can work together if they wish but there is no requirement for them to do so
 however other candidates might consider that buddhists desire to reduce dukkha not just for themselves but for everyone and scientific discovery can contribute greatly to this aim
 however it is important to not become attached to things of this world and devoting too much energy to scientific development could detract from what is truly important
 as in all things buddhists should follow the middle way if science interests them they should not be barred from it but neither should it be considered to be the solution to all of problems
 june mark there are people in the world today especially in the west who consider that not only are religion and science mutually exclusive but that science has removed the need or basis for religion entirely
 some candidates might expand on this by exploring the parallel development of science and religion in the east where there is much less sense of conflict between the two
 others might focus on the extreme in modern society who would undoubtedly reject the statement arguing instead that people should focus entirely on science and what can be proven via the scientific method
 candidate might discuss where this line is drawn or note that scientists are people and their own beliefs of whatever type could affect their work
 willingness to question and challenge even the most dearly held assumptions is a key element of scientific work and a range of people involved in it should only add to the richness of the mix

 candidates might consider some of the one approach to the issue might to consider the difference between fundamentalist or biblical literalists and more liberal christians
 biblical literalists consider this story to be true in a literal sense and such christians would therefore support the creation the creation of all life in its current forms and the lack of a need for evolution
 some candidates might equate this with young earth creationism perhaps distinguishing between this stance and the claims of intelligent design theorists
 christians holding this view are perfectly able to accept scientific theories and discoveries as simply providing evidence for the ways in which god achieved the present state of creation
 they could then contrast these with those of christians who have no difficulty accepting the theory if one is not a literalist the biblical account can be figurative there is still the possibility of god evolution and so on
 for christians who consider scripture to be literal and absolute truth there would be no point in working with science and arguably little point in science at all although few would take things to this extreme
 more liberal christians who do not find scientific discovery threatening to their beliefs are more likely to agree with the statement
 some christians may perceive the scientific process as a means of coming closer to god by exploring the wonders of creation
 it is also possible that some christians might seek to use the scientific method and establishment to seek to disprove controversial theories which threaten beliefs

 hindus holding this view are perfectly able to accept scientific theories and discoveries as simply providing evidence for the ways in which god achieved the present state of creation
 june mark there are also hindus who do not regard the question as being one of any particular importance since it does not contribute to liberation
 there are many different scriptures in hinduism and among them scriptural support for the belief that it is alright not to know things can be found
 some hindu philosophers have concluded that both spirit and matter are eternal any kind of created universe and that conscious beings have developed from the interaction between the two another evolutionary idea
 alternatively candidates might argue that the immanence of brahman means that the origins of life are clear all things are brahman and brahman simply wills them to take the forms they do
 many individuals believe that religious faith and science are entirely compatible and that both can contribute to investigations about the origins of human life

 this implies a general harmony with current scientific theories which postulate a cycle of expansion and contraction with the constant evolution of life

 registered company number with its registered office at edinburgh gate harlow essex holden ever play in mixed communities in sociology review volume number issues of integration in ethnically diverse areas are often the subject of social and political debate
 in this research andrew holden focused on play in local park playgrounds and school playgrounds spaces occupied by children from different ethnic groups
 he wanted to examine the extent to which play at different ages and in different settings either reinforces or overcomes the segregation of different ethnic groups
 he aimed to establish what the parents felt about integrative play and whether they thought it could have a positive effect on communities
 in the first three months of the study he carried out secondary research to build up a detailed background knowledge
 substantial amount of information was collected from published documents such as the census the local play strategy early years publications and website material
 three months into the study during the spring and summer months holden carried out a series of overt observations which gathered mainly quantitative data
 total of observations were conducted in public parks and school playgrounds spaces occupied by children from two main ethnic groups and where one might expect to see some integrative play taking place
 the parks chosen were three largest parks two of which were situated in heavily areas and one which was in a mixed community
 these six schools were chosen on the basis of their ethnic and cultural diversity and none of the schools had less than a white or asian population
 the observational data was recorded on a structured schedule the purpose of which was to identify the nature and extent of play in blackburn and to establish whether play was integrated or segregated
 shortly after the observations had taken place a parental attitudes survey was carried out in the form of a structured questionnaire
 the aim of the survey was to establish what parents thought about integrative play and to consider how this could be best facilitated
 using opportunity sampling the researchers gained access to the parents of children from each ethnic group in a variety of public settings including schools colleges community centres and workplaces
 the results of the park observations showed that although there was plenty of free play happening there was very little integrative play between different ethnic groups
 white and asian children played in close proximity with each other but there were few signs of conversation between different ethnic groups and no real evidence of mixing
 in contrast the primary school observations revealed that during their playtime the children engaged positively with members of different ethnic groups
 play was lively and spontaneous and consisted of groups of children who enjoyed playing together and for whom ethnic membership seemed insignificant
 over of white and of asian parents stated that it was either very important or fairly important for children from different ethnic groups to play together
 although integrative play was more common in schools than parks there were also variations in play between the different educational sectors

 the force or threat of force must be used in order to steal so there is no robbery if the force is only used when trying to escape after the theft or if the force was accidental
 the theft occurs at the time of the appropriation but again the courts have taken a very flexible approach to this rule
 the court of appeal upheld the convictions on the basis that appropriation was a continuing act and it was open to the jury to conclude on facts that it was still continuing at the time the force was applied
 the breadth of the offence of robbery carries the danger that relatively minor criminal conduct can incur unduly harsh sentences with the offence of robbery potentially carrying a life sentence
 for the purposes of robbery has been interpreted to include minor violence such as pulling on a handbag or barging into someone
 but the impact of a finding of force is significant because it raises the maximum possible sentence from seven to life imprisonment
 argues persuasively that the law should distinguish between the different degrees of force recommends that the current single offence should be divided into two separate offences which would depend on the gravity of harm used or threatened
 app mr locke had submitted at the end of the case that what had happened could not in law amount to the use of force
 he called the learned attention to some old authorities and submitted that because of those old authorities there was not enough evidence to go to the jury
 the object of the act was to get rid of all the old technicalities of the law of larceny and to put the law into simple language which juries would understand and which they themselves would use
 the learned judge because of the argument put forward by mr locke went out of his way to explain to the jury that force in these sort of circumstances must be substantial to justify a verdict
 whether it was right for him to put that adjective before the word when parliament had not done so we will not discuss for the purposes of this case

 it is a continuous act and it is a matter for the jury to decide whether or not the act of appropriation has finished
 moreover it is quite clear that the intention to deprive the owner permanently which accompanied the assumption of the rights was a continuing one at all material times

 the issue arose again before the court of appeal in ryan but unfortunately the picture still remains unclarified the defendant found himself charged with burglary and was in due course convicted
 however the court of appeal following brown held that a person could enter a building even if only part of his body was actually within the premises

 verbal answers in english the basic principle of assessment is that candidates should gain credit for what they know understand and can do
 however these aspects are an integral part of assessing communication and marks cannot be awarded where errors in spelling punctuation or grammar lead to a failure to communicate the required information without ambiguity
 where a candidate has given alternatives or additional information in answer the following criteria should be if the does not contradict the key idea or make it ambiguous if the contradicts the key idea or makes it ambiguous reject
 where numbered lines are given within a of a question credit should be given for correct answers no matter which line they appear on
 where a question has more than one section a candidate may include as part of the answer to one section the information required to answer another section

 marking instructions handling of unexpected answers if you are not sure how to apply the mark scheme to an answer you should contact your team leader
 select and demonstrate clearly relevant knowledge and understanding through the use of evidence examples and correct language and terminology appropriate to the course of study
 in order to ensure the marking scheme can be and consistently and to examiners to mark in a standardised it defines levels of response by which answers are assessed
 this ensures that comparable standards are applied across the various units as well as within the team of examiners marking a particular unit
 levels of response are defined according to the two assessment in advanced subsidiary the questions are in two parts each addressing a single topic and targeted explicitly at one of the objectives
 in the marking scheme each question is provided with a brief outline of the likely content lines of argument of a answer but this is by no means prescriptive or exhaustive
 examiners must not attempt to reward answers according to the extent to which they match the structure of the outline or mention the points it contains
 the specification is designed to allow teachers to approach the content of modules in a variety of ways from any of a number of perspectives and answers must be assessed in the light of this flexibility of approach
 it is quite possible for an excellent and valid answer to contain knowledge and arguments which do not appear in the each answer must be assessed on its own merits according to the levels of response

 question mark scheme indicative content there will inevitably be some story telling from candidates as they identify abraham and this is worth some credit
 marks better responses are likely to focus on explaining significant points from the set texts in the specification and in the exegesis demonstrate some familiarity with the actual textual passages
 explanations may look at the background in ancient near in connection with explaining types of covenant but whilst creditable this is not essential for full marks
 taking the initiative the role of faith the promises of land and people and the covenant of circumcision are likely to predominate in good responses
 this topic might be approached from many equally valid angles and candidates are free to argue from any standpoint but should be mindful of the words important in the question
 abraham was called to set out in faith to a new land in genesis some candidates might use this evidence to demonstrate the importance of land from the very start of the covenant story
 june guidance mark scheme question indicative content the covenants made with abraham might be considered separately or together as candidates try to balance the relative importance of the promises in these covenants
 marks most candidates are likely to demonstrate some awareness that exodus contains the ten commandments that were given at sinai
 some might attempt at analysis of the significant features of the decalogue or an explanation of these apodictic laws in relation to their importance in covenant terms for the israelites
 some candidates might point out that the conclusion of exodus includes the rulings about the building of altars and candidates might comment about the way these altars contrast starkly with the high places of the surrounding nations
 june guidance the best responses are likely to be those which reflect knowledge and understanding of the actual set text
 marks implicitly or explicitly the best discussions might therefore make reference to exodus book of the which includes casuistic laws
 candidates are likely to begin with an introduction about elijah and ahab and jezebel in the ninth century in the northern kingdom israel of which the capital was samaria
 the account of the events leading to the murder of naboth and subsequent confrontation with the king are found in kings and candidates are likely to take the opportunity to give details of the story
 june guidance question mark scheme indicative content candidates might comment on ahab sulking and the assumptions that jezebel the phoenician has about what kingship entails as well recounting her manipulations
 the culpability of the elders and officials the two unscrupulous witnesses and the gullible crowd point towards israelite society becoming more corrupt and like the neighbouring countries
 marks in religious terms the previous confrontations with elijah had been about prophets of baal and the growing syncretism of religion with the canaanite fertility cults
 with vineyard political and social religious ethics are in the spotlight as elijah speaks truth to power about the abrogation of the rights of an individual
 nathan in king israel might be referred to as a worthy precedent of a prophet involved in both religion and politics
 he had proved the of israel to be the controller of nature and more powerful than the canaanite baalim and ashtaroth including phoenician baal melkart
 candidates are also likely to include reference to mount horeb where was not in the wind earthquake and fire but in the still small voice of conscience
 june guidance credit reference to this incident preparing the way for the eighth century prophets but this is not compulsory as these are not studied in detail until the specification
 mark scheme question indicative content candidates might argue that the prophets of israel and judah never forgot their nomadic past and their covenant commitment
 marks candidates might give an account of the story of jonah and the story of job but the better responses are likely to use the narratives to address the question
 june guidance candidates might explain which features might require suspension of disbelief and why they might seem difficult to believe literally or as historical fact
 candidates might include the scene in the heavenly court from and not just the big fish and the storm but the miraculous growth of the plant etc
 in candidates might demonstrate understanding by distinguishing between literature that is hard to believe as historical fact but not hard to believe metaphorically or spiritually as parables or wisdom literature
 in their response candidates might draw on evidence from the first part of the question to identify areas that seem difficult to believe literally or as historical fact
 candidates are likely to attempt to define the meaning of the phrase does not and explore the range of reasons this might be so from various academic religious viewpoints
 candidates might discuss the extent to which the books are intended to be historical accounts or literary constructs to highlight theological issues

 mention of the arbitration act and the scott v avery clause are the level of detail that would be likely for high level marks
 level if no illustrations are given an answer cannot go beyond the top of level as the question specifically asks for illustration
 mark scheme question content agreement to go to arbitration can be made before a dispute arises by a scott v avery clause in a agreement will either name an arbitrator or provide a method for choosing one
 the parties agree the procedure for hearings and this ranges from a arbitration to a formal court like hearing arbitration awards are binding on the parties and can be enforced by the courts if necessary

 this mark scheme includes any amendments made at the standardisation meeting attended by all examiners and is the scheme which was used by them in this examination
 the standardisation meeting ensures that the mark scheme covers the responses to questions and that every examiner understands and applies it in the same correct way
 as preparation for the standardisation meeting each examiner analyses a number of alternative answers not already covered by the mark scheme are discussed at the meeting and legislated for
 if after this meeting examiners encounter unusual answers which have not been discussed at the meeting they are required to refer these to the principal examiner
 it must be stressed that a mark scheme is a working document in many cases further developed and expanded on the basis of reactions to a particular paper
 assumptions about future mark schemes on the basis of one document should be whilst the guiding principles of assessment remain constant details will change depending on the content of a particular examination paper
 the extra information is aligned to the appropriate answer in the part of the mark scheme and should only be applied to that item in the mark scheme
 in general the right hand side of the mark scheme is there to provide those extra details which confuse the main part of the mark scheme yet may be helpful in ensuring that marking is straightforward and consistent
 emboldening in a list of acceptable answers where more than one mark is available two is used with the number of marks emboldened
 terms in the mark scheme are shown by a eg allow smooth free marking points marking of lists this applies to questions requiring a set number of responses but for which candidates have provided extra responses

 all examiners are instructed that alternative correct answers and unexpected approaches in scripts must be given marks that fairly reflect the relevant knowledge and skills demonstrated
 mark scheme june annotations annotation meaning blank page this annotation must be used on all blank pages within an answer booklet or and on each page of an additional object where there is no candidate response
 marking instructions handling of unexpected answers if you are not sure how to apply the mark scheme to an answer you should contact your team leader
 select and demonstrate clearly relevant knowledge and understanding through the use of evidence examples and correct language and terminology appropriate to the course of study
 in order to ensure the marking scheme can be and consistently and to examiners to mark in a standardised it defines levels of response by which answers are assessed
 this ensures that comparable standards are applied across the various units as well as within the team of examiners marking a particular unit
 levels of response are defined according to the two assessment in advanced subsidiary the questions are in two parts each addressing a single topic and targeted explicitly at one of the objectives
 in the marking scheme each question is provided with a brief outline of the likely content lines of argument of a answer but this is by no means prescriptive or exhaustive
 examiners must not attempt to reward answers according to the extent to which they match the structure of the outline or mention the points it contains
 the specification is designed to allow teachers to approach the content of modules in a variety of ways from any of a number of perspectives and answers must be assessed in the light of this flexibility of approach
 it is quite possible for an excellent and valid answer to contain knowledge and arguments which do not appear in the each answer must be assessed on its own merits according to the levels of response
 mark scheme june key skill of this is assessed at both advanced subsidiary and as an integral part of the marking scheme
 question mark scheme indicative content candidates may interpret the essenes role or place in society or the importance of their beliefs in the wider context of the judaism of the time
 candidates may explain the view that the essenes withdrew from society at the end of the maccabean war as they regarded the temple as having been polluted by a high priest
 they then withdrew from society to qumran where they had little interaction with other jewish sects and substituted prayer for sacrifice as they awaited eschatological vindication
 another view is that they would have support in towns and cities throughout palestine josephus refers to an in jerusalem
 some may wish to look at recent revisionist accounts based on classical sources which give the essenes a significant role in society as oracles healers and legal interpreters
 candidates may wish to make links to other religious parties in order to explain the significance of these beliefs and explain how essene beliefs show the diversity of ancient judaism
 marks june guidance candidates may support their arguments with reference to the dead sea scrolls classical authors such as pliny and jospehus
 question mark scheme indicative content it might be argued that jesus in his criticism of the corruption of the temple and the jewish religious leaders echoed the rejection of the rulers of the firstcentury jerusalem temple
 marks in the cleansing of the temple actions in overturning the tables of those who sold sacrifices might also seem in accord with beliefs
 however the manner of the triumphal entry and other indications of jesus as a peaceful and dying messiah did not reflect the belief in a priestly and a warrior messiah
 also it is unclear whether the essenes had any beliefs about resurrection but jesus firmly predicts and fulfils his own resurrection promise
 some candidates might comment on the fact that jesus taught against legalism and he criticised the pharisees for their attitude to the sabbath and adherence to laws
 some may wish to make a link between jesus and the essenes via john the baptist who some think may have been an essene
 question mark scheme indicative content candidates are likely to explain and compare the significant features from the two matthew and mark and marks june guidance candidates should attempt an explanation of the differences and not merely describe them
 in matthew the women are not silent but run afraid but filled with joy a possible reference to the joy of the kings at birth
 in contrast it could be argued with reference to solutions to the synoptic problem that the similarities merely show that matthew copied mark and not that the accounts are true
 some might argue that the similarities are outweighed by the differences and that the apologetic nature of extra passages casts doubt on both accounts
 some candidates might argue that the resurrection is not a matter of evidential fact and that both accounts of the resurrection might be seen as the individual gospel vision of the truth
 prediction that peter would deny him three times before the cock crowed was met boastfully by peter that he would die with jesus but he would not deny him
 peter keeps his promise not to desert jesus and follows the arresting party to the house where he waits in the courtyard to see what will happen to jesus
 is a prominent number peter is challenged three times and three times he denies knowing jesus and the account is a between the account of the two trials
 in the passion narrative the disciples are unable to accept or understand predictions of his suffering they fail to keep watch in gethsemane and their failure reaches its climax when they desert jesus
 one view might be that mark is not judging the disciples but showing through their failure general human weakness in contrast with authority and divinity
 depiction of the disciples might be assessed in relation to the background of his writing which is believed to be in rome under persecution and in response to a pressing need to encourage early christian followers to be steadfast
 candidates might question whether some of the accounts that involve the disciples are inventions by mark to serve his purpose
 some candidates might examine further theological peter is redeemed in the resurrection account and the disciples are given their commission the longer only judas remains beyond the pale and there are some scholarly doubts about his existence
 marks june guidance question mark scheme indicative content candidates may begin by explaining that the mark shows the crucifixion to be will by showing knowledge of his fate in the early stages of the passion narrative
 wine mixed with myrrh and explore other links in the darkness and the rending of the temple candidates might give some examples but not necessarily all
 candidates may explain that the crucifixion is in the sense of a sacrifice and may make reference to the idea of the paschal lamb scapegoat or maccabean martyrs
 question mark scheme indicative content candidates might consider whether it was purpose to discredit the jews for their rejection of jesus and equally to condemn the romans as the instruments of his death
 marks evidence might be offered from the text of the complicity of both parties with a probably illegal trial false witnesses and insistence on the death penalty on the part of the jews
 some responses might consider editorial purpose in writing of attempts to release jesus and the historical accuracy of such a custom and the nature of pilate
 was mark trying to absolve the romans bearing in mind his candidates might also conclude that there is evidence throughout the passion narrative of condemnation of the rejection of jesus and signs of impending judgment upon them

 he told the pharisees that they were going against the word of god with the traditions they had handed down and they did many things like that
 perhaps for some people the real message of a religion appears to be lost behind too many of these rules and they form a negative picture of religion

 another view might be that that rules are important they ensure that people behave according to beliefs and principles and live in a strong harmonious community where others are respected

 also there might be practical difficulties within the different branches of christianity as to which would be the most suitable time of year for only one festival
 also in a country like britain public holidays are linked with certain christian festivals so there might have to be changes
 other arguments might consider further advantages such as greater anticipation and enjoyment of one less interference with daily life for the rest of the year

 june mark candidates might consider some of the this is an important story for christians today because christians might follow the example of jesus and put the teaching from the story into practice
 when jesus replied to the request to heal her daughter the woman indicated that she recognised jesus was referring to the jews as having priority over others as the chosen ones of god
 the reply the dogs under the table eat the showed that she recognised that all people had an equal right to mercy and help and that love was universal
 the faith in ultimate mercy for all humankind is an important teaching for christians because question to the woman challenged her her reply pleased him and he healed her daughter
 sometimes christians might be tempted to discriminate as to who is deserving of help particularly if people are not christians or appear to have no faith
 june mark candidates might consider some of the answers might concentrate on the story of the woman or other examples from the text of gospel that candidates have studied
 on miracles and exorcisms or conflict with the authorities might be used as evidence to demonstrate that jesus deliberately challenged the teachers of the law the pharisees and the traditions of his time
 the evaluation might focus on the danger jesus was in as the religious authorities plotted against him and manipulated events to achieve his arrest and death
 however a balanced view might be that purpose was to rebel and challenge the religious views of his time and the real value of universal love and forgiveness

 question mark scheme answer responses might june mark guidance there must be some indication that a vihara is a place used specifically by the monastic sangha
 responses might relics of a buddhist monk or holy man relics of the buddha rupas prayer flags prayer wheels mark for each response
 these may come from any buddhist school and might include rupas offerings prayer wheels thankas vajras depictions of bodhisattvas the wheel of life the eyes of the buddha etc
 rupas or images of bodhisattvas might remind buddhists of certain qualities in these figures or that they themselves would like to develop
 prayer wheels are believed by some to have a practical as well as a symbolic value as they generate merit that is then distributed to the world
 symbols can help to express ideas beliefs or feelings that are not easily conveyed in words and this can deepen an spiritual experience or understanding
 certain symbols particularly those that are predominantly artistic can create an ambience or atmosphere that makes it easier for some people to think in a way or respond to a experience
 this might be particularly important for buddhists living in countries where buddhism is not the primary religion as it can help to foster a community spirit and a feeling of connectedness
 it is helpful to worship as a community as this can help to faith and to provide an environment in which discussion and mutual support can take place
 while there is no requirement in buddhism for communal worship there are emotional benefits as worshipping with others can be an uplifting experience
 some buddhists believe that the merit generated by some forms of worship can be used for the benefit of all sentient beings and this can be another benefit of public worship
 guidance mark scheme question answer in countries public worship can also raise the profile and public awareness of buddhism and give it a bigger stake in the community
 conversely buddhists do not generally believe in a deity who receives and responds to worship so is more an act of personal and spiritual development than it might be understood in other religions
 for this reason some might argue that worship is essentially a personal and individual activity and that there is no particular benefit to be derived from worshipping in public
 spelling punctuation and grammar are assessed using the separate marking grid on page responses might spag buddhist monk member of the monastic sangha ordained into monastic orders mark for response
 candidates might consider some of the some candidates might suggest that the family is not greatly important to buddhists since buddhism encourages renunciation and withdrawal from through the monastic sangha
 families might be seen as a source of distraction or attachment which could lead to tanha and so make it more difficult for an individual to achieve nibbana
 some candidates might suggest that this view is more likely to be held by theravada rather than mahayana buddhists
 candidates might point out that many buddhist cultures have strong traditions of family values and that family life is a good way of passing on buddhist teachings and traditions
 family life is an excellent way of cultivating qualities such as patience and compassion which are vital to spiritual progress
 there is nothing in the five precepts to preclude family life and indeed many guidance responses may be from any buddhist school or tradition and may include ordination as a novice or as a bhikkhu
 separate marks for each thing mark scheme question answer of the virtues which it encourages are best developed in this setting
 june mark while there is a place for the monastic sangha the lay community is equally important and indeed is in a symbiotic relationship with the monastic sangha which makes family life a of buddhism
 candidates might consider some of the candidates might refer to buddhist teachings about impermanence and attachment and suggest that material possessions must necessarily lead onto tanha and so make it impossible to attain enlightenment
 one of the precepts forbids members of the monastic sangha from handling money and this might lead to the conclusion that money should be avoided by buddhists seeking enlightenment
 on the other hand much of the ethical teaching of buddhism calls for honour and honesty in financial dealings rather than a complete renunciation of wealth
 there have been wealthy and powerful buddhists as the emperor who have used their wealth and influence for the good and furtherment of buddhism and there has never been a suggestion that this was wrong
 for these people being rich might well be evidence that the person had lived a buddhist life in a previous life or is doing so in this life
 responses might rules for the monks and nuns to obey for communal living the punishments for breaking the for dealing with conflict in the monastic community examples of individual rules from the vinaya pitaka mark for each response
 candidates might consider some of the candidates must deal with why scriptures are treated with respect and not simply describe the ways in which such respect is shown in order to reach the highest level
 this is a good reason to treat them with respect as they provide a chain of connection to the founder who achieved enlightenment and therefore presumably can help others to do so
 even where the scriptures are not attributed directly to the buddha they are believed to have been written by wise and enlightened teachers and so are worthy of respect for the things that they can teach us
 some buddhists believe that reciting the scriptures can create merit which can be used for the benefit of all sentient beings and therefore they are worthy of reverence in their own right
 some buddhists believe that while the scriptures are useful they have only contingent value in so far as an individual finds them to be useful and so may be treated with respect but not with reverence
 candidates might consider some of the candidates might argue that the use of multiple scriptures is confusing and that this is particularly so when they contradict or appear to contradict each other
 mark on the other hand it could be pointed out that there is no single version of the pali canon that is accepted by all buddhists so not even this is a text
 furthermore the buddha himself considered the dhamma to be contingent and of worth only so far as it proved itself to be useful to an individual
 there is no intrinsic reason to favour some of these writings above others purely on grounds of age or authorship

 all examiners are instructed that alternative correct answers and unexpected approaches in scripts must be given marks that fairly reflect the relevant knowledge and skills demonstrated
 mark scheme june annotations annotation meaning blank page this annotation must be used on all blank pages within an answer booklet or and on each page of an additional object where there is no candidate response
 marking instructions handling of unexpected answers if you are not sure how to apply the mark scheme to an answer you should contact your team leader
 select and demonstrate clearly relevant knowledge and understanding through the use of evidence examples and correct language and terminology appropriate to the course of study
 in order to ensure the marking scheme can be and consistently and to examiners to mark in a standardised it defines levels of response by which answers are assessed
 this ensures that comparable standards are applied across the various units as well as within the team of examiners marking a particular unit
 levels of response are defined according to the two assessment in advanced subsidiary the questions are in two parts each addressing a single topic and targeted explicitly at one of the objectives
 in the marking scheme each question is provided with a brief outline of the likely content lines of argument of a answer but this is by no means prescriptive or exhaustive
 examiners must not attempt to reward answers according to the extent to which they match the structure of the outline or mention the points it contains
 the specification is designed to allow teachers to approach the content of modules in a variety of ways from any of a number of perspectives and answers must be assessed in the light of this flexibility of approach
 it is quite possible for an excellent and valid answer to contain knowledge and arguments which do not appear in the each answer must be assessed on its own merits according to the levels of response
 mark scheme june key skill of this is assessed at both advanced subsidiary and as an integral part of the marking scheme
 question mark scheme june indicative content marks guidance candidates are likely to define the terms monism monotheism and polytheism and then relate them to hinduism in order to address the focus of the question
 monism might be defined in philosophical terms as the idea that what appears to be a variety of things can actually be explained in terms of a single substance or reality
 in terms of hinduism candidates are likely to be aware of the concept of brahman as the eternal unchanging reality or the ground of all being
 candidates might explain that of these views are monistic because they see brahman as the source of all that is in existence
 some traditions such as shaivism or vaishnavism are devoted to the worship of a single deity while others incorporate more than one
 however even hindus who consider themselves to be devotees of one particular deity may offer puja to other deities in specific circumstances
 candidates might want to explain that hindu traditions do not generally suggest that one god is to be preferred over others in any sense
 however candidates might also consider this to be a distortion since the deities are regarded by many hindus as aspects of brahman
 smartas in particular accept all the gods but are clear that brahman is the single ultimate reality returning the argument again to monism
 candidates may use the terms advaita and vishishtadvaita but they are not expected to do so mark scheme candidates might observe that there are a vast number of deities in hinduism
 they might then argue that this makes hinduism a polytheist religion even if some individual hindus choose to worship only one of these
 evidence from puja practices might be used to support this especially in relation to shrines in the home which often house several murti
 they might argue that the choice to devote oneself to a single deity carries the implication that this is the supreme or better deity
 alternatively they might be aware that for most hindus even those who are wholly devoted to a single deity there is no belief in a single path to liberation
 although it may seem contradictory to be monotheistic and polytheistic candidates might identify hinduism in this it can be both because of monist ideas about brahman
 if brahman is the source of all that exists then there is clearly only a single supreme reality whichever form of monism is accepted
 however through the acceptance and worship of different deities hinduism recognises that not everyone is able to see or engage with this truth
 the variety of traditions embraced by hinduism means that parts of the faith can be categorised as polytheistic and other forms as monotheistic
 june mark scheme candidates might identify bhakti as one of the four margas each of which offers a different path for reaching moksha
 this means that bhaktas offer all their worship and service to a specific deity a focus on god as personal rather than the impersonal transcendent reality of brahman
 for a hindu following the bhakti path all actions should be done in the remembrance of or ishvara the personal or cherished god
 ishvara is a term particularly associated with shaivism and candidates might explore the details of this or any other tradition of devotion to a particular deity
 this in itself could render it a harder path some people may not be able to afford the time or resources necessary and some people may not have the ability for various reasons
 they might contrast this with bhakti by suggesting that prayer or service can be offered to god anywhere as a part of everyday life
 however other candidates might suggest that to keep god always in mind requires a degree of dedication and that is extremely hard to achieve
 concentrating on scripture might be an easier way to avoid these distractions than trying to maintain an inner awareness of god in the hustle of daily life
 although all the paths have difficulties candidates might argue that jnana is the hardest path as to truly overcome maya means detaching oneself from the world in way that the other paths do not seem to require
 they might draw on the account of the margas given by krishna in the bhagavad gita noting that they are suited to different types of karma yoga is practical and focussed on jnana on study and bhakti on god
 shakti might be considered as a specific deity or more generally as the dynamic energy of movement and change which balances the static changeless energy of the masculine
 although shakti means more than a collective term for goddesses candidates might choose to explain how it is understood in relation to specific deities
 candidates could suggest that this creative power makes shakti more important than the masculine principle while others might consider the two interdependent with the masculine providing the potential on which the feminine acts to produce change
 this could lead to a more general explanation of the role and importance of goddesses in hinduism and the ways in which they manifest or represent shakti
 june mark scheme june question indicative content marks guidance candidates might focus their response on particular deities or pairs of deities considering for example whether lakshmi is more accessible than vishnu or parvati more so that shiva
 any stories about the relationships between these deities should be linked back to the central issue of the question and used to illustrate why they might be more or less easy to worship
 some candidates might point out that some deities are regarded as different forms or aspects of a single god or goddess and their approachability for worshippers might vary according to the particular manifestation
 for example kali might be seen as less easy to worship than durga although they are different aspects of the same goddess
 another approach might be to consider the areas or issues with which deities are associated such as saraswati and the arts or lakshmi and wealth
 they might explore whether goddesses are associated more with every day concerns than gods and whether hindus approach different deities in different situations
 the frequency of their worship might be taken as evidence that male deities are not considered hard to worship by many hindus
 for example women might prefer to take personal concerns to a goddess in the same way some women prefer to see female they are seen as more likely to understand
 they might also consider the cultural implications of female deities and the effect these may may have had on gender equality within hinduism
 candidates might begin with a brief description of vaishnavism but this should be directed towards the how and why of the question
 this role means that it is vishnu who acts at times when the balance of good and evil is disturbed
 hindu scriptures suggest there is another avatar yet to come which suggests that this activity is ongoing and encourages the worship of vishnu
 in regard to the part of the question candidates might explore forms of worship such as puja meditation and the use of tilaks as signs of their devotion
 alternatively candidates might consider the vaishnavite tradition of diksha in which the worshipper is given a personal mantra by their guru
 the question asks how and why and both must be addressed for the higher levels although this need not be in equal amounts
 identifying brahma as the creator and shiva as the destroyer could enable candidates to support the view of vishnu as the most important because he preserves dharma
 candidates might contrast importance with either shiva or brahma or alternatively they may present the view that the three are interdependent
 because the cycle of creation and destruction is necessary and continuous both brahma and shiva must perform their roles more than once and the preservation which is role must one day prove unsuccessful
 this does not render it futile but it does imply that no single role can be presented as more important than any of the others
 some candidates might question when where and by whom the importance of different deities is judged arguing that importance will vary in different times and when judged by different people

 examiners should also be prepared to award zero marks if the response is not worthy of credit according to the mark scheme

 when examiners are in doubt regarding the application of the mark scheme to a response the team leader must be consulted
 history marking guidance marking of levels of response the mark scheme provides an indication of the sorts of answer that might be found at different levels
 it is intended as a guide and it will be necessary therefore for examiners to use their professional judgement in deciding both at which level a question has been answered and how effectively points have been sustained
 candidates should always be rewarded according to the quality of thought expressed in their answer and not solely according to the amount of knowledge conveyed
 however candidates with only a superficial knowledge will be unable to develop or sustain points sufficiently to move to higher levels
 at the end of each answer examiners should look back on the answer as a whole in the light of these general criteria in order to ensure that the total mark reflects their overall impression of the worth
 deciding on the mark point within a level the first stage is to decide the overall level and then whether the work represents high mid or low performance within the level
 one stronger passage at level would not by itself merit a level award but it would be evidence to support a high level award unless there were also substantial weaknesses in other areas
 assessing quality of written communication qowc will have a bearing if the qowc is inconsistent with the communication descriptor for the level in which the answer falls
 if for example a history response displays mid level criteria but fits the level qowc descriptors it will require a move down within the level
 these will be supported by limited factual material which has some accuracy and relevance although not directed at the focus of the question
 they will however include material which is either descriptive and thus only implicitly relevant to the focus or which strays from that focus
 candidates offer an analytical response which relates well to the focus of the question and which shows some understanding of the key issues contained in it
 the candidate will demonstrate the skills needed to produce convincing extended writing but there may be passages which lack clarity or coherence
 candidates offer an analytical response which directly addresses the focus of the question and which demonstrates explicit understanding of the key issues contained in it
 mid level marks as per descriptor high level marks the qualities of level are securely material is convincing in range and depth consistent with level the exposition will be controlled and the deployment logical
 thus most candidates whose historical understanding related to a given question suggests that they should sit in a particular level will express that understanding in ways which broadly conform to the communication descriptor appropriate to that level
 indicators of written communication are best considered normatively and may be used to help decide a specific mark to be awarded within a level
 quality of written communication which fails to conform to the descriptor for the level will depress the award of marks by a within the level

 comprehensive purge of the communist party eliminated most of those who attended the congress of victors and replaced the existing party elite with one totally obedient to stalin

 registered company number with its registered office at edinburgh gate harlow essex mathematics linear mark scheme nov mark schemes are prepared by the principal examiner and considered together with the relevant questions by a panel of subject teachers
 this mark scheme includes any amendments made at the standardisation meeting attended by all examiners and is the scheme which was used by them in this examination
 the standardisation meeting ensures that the mark scheme covers the responses to questions and that every examiner understands and applies it in the same correct way
 as preparation for the standardisation meeting each examiner analyses a number of alternative answers not already covered by the mark scheme are discussed at the meeting and legislated for
 if after this meeting examiners encounter unusual answers which have not been discussed at the meeting they are required to refer these to the principal examiner
 it must be stressed that a mark scheme is a working document in many cases further developed and expanded on the basis of reactions to a particular paper
 assumptions about future mark schemes on the basis of one document should be whilst the guiding principles of assessment remain constant details will change depending on the content of a particular examination paper

 june mark candidates might consider some of the being loyal to yourself means keeping to your beliefs and principles in any situation
 on the other hand loyalty to others is an important principle and christians value their relationship with others and see it as particularly important to e
 loyalty is not simply a matter of giving in to pressure to support people or causes regardless of whether they are right or wrong
 it might be concluded that being loyal to oneself means that when a person holds strongly to their own beliefs and principles they will act in the best interest of others and themselves

 man calls on his friend at an inconvenient time midnight when the house is locked and everyone has gone to bed 
the reason for his request borrow three is not solely for himself but because another friend who is on a journey has called and he has nothing to give him
 he will respond to the needs of his people if they ask but they too must persist in offering their prayers and be genuine in their belief that prayer will be answered
 june mark candidates might consider some of the candidates are likely to argue that on the face of it prayers about personal matters should be done in private and kept to oneself
 there might be some embarrassment about praying about such matters or even praying at all so people prefer to do this in a private place
 on the other hand in christian churches public prayer includes matters that are personal such as forgiveness of sins and requests for strength
 so there is a personal element in all forms of in some christian churches there is the tradition of the confessional where sins of all kinds are confessed to a priest and advice given
 it might also be helpful for a person to pray about personal matters with a priest church member or a who shares the same beliefs
 it might cause others to be concerned about the need for pastoral care and support for a parishioner who needs help or a sick person
 balanced view might be that praying in private has many benefits but to some degree the needs of people are recognised and also catered for in public worship or worship with others
 the personal response might be based upon consideration of arguments and evidence including christian views their own observations or convictions supported with reasons

 socialists use social class as an analytical tool viewing classes as the principal actors in history and the main source of economic and social change
 this is most evident in the marxist belief that class conflict is the motor of history capitalist society being doomed because the propertyless proletariat are destined to rise up and overthrow the the bourgeoisie

 some view anarchism less as a single doctrine and more as a point of overlap between two quite different doctrines liberalism and socialism the point at which both reach conclusions
 the former encompasses mutualism and while the latter encompasses egoism libertarianism and although mutualism and some forms of libertarianism have much in common and anarchocapitalism differ starkly especially over matters such as wealth ownership and economic organisation

 indicative content is not an exhaustive account of relevant identity politics is characterised by attempts to counter actual or perceived group marginalisation by encouraging its members to embrace a more positive sense of identity
 emancipation and social advancement for oppressed cultural groups is strongly linked to the development and celebration of an and more positive identity especially when that identity receives public recognition and respect
 radical feminists tend to view the process of conditioning in the family the distribution of housework and other responsibilities and the politics of personal and sexual conduct as the root of patriarchal oppression
 some feminists have also criticised the divide in that it conceals aspects of female oppression such as the failure to recognise the significance of domestic work carried out by women in the home
 the nation is a collection of people bound together by shared values and traditions common language religion and history and usually occupying the same geographical area
 nationalism is therefore based on the assumption that first humankind is naturally divided into discrete nations and second that the nation is the most appropriate and perhaps the only legitimate unit of political rule
 classical political nationalism set out to bring the borders of the state into line with the boundaries of the nation creating within which nationality and citizenship would coincide
 racialism is the belief that political or social conclusions can be drawn from the idea that humankind is divided into biologically distinct racialist theories are based on two assumptions
 first there are fundamental genetic or differences amongst the peoples of the world and second these divisions are reflected in cultural intellectual and moral differences
 threshold level response will typically exhibit the following limited understanding of at least one distinction between nationalism and racialism
 on what grounds have conservatives criticised indicative content is not an exhaustive account of relevant the chief conservative objection to multiculturalism is that shared values and a common culture are a necessary precondition for a stable and successful society
 from this perspective multiculturalism is inherently flawed multicultural societies being inevitably fractured and societies in which suspicion hostility and even violence are commonplace
 threshold level response will typically exhibit the following limited understanding of at least one ground on which conservatives have criticised multiculturalism
 threshold level response will typically exhibit the following clear and accurate understanding of the grounds on which conservatives have criticised multiculturalism
 liberalism is compatible with feminism in that the principle of individualism implies that individuals are entitled to equal treatment regardless of their sex
 if individuals are to be judged it should be on rational grounds on the content of their character their talents or their personal worth
 liberalism thus inspired the movement for female suffrage and it has also been associated with campaigns to break down the remaining legal and social pressures that restrict women gaining an education pursuing careers and being politically active
 feminism is compatible with socialism to the extent that patriarchy can only be understood in the light of social and economic factors
 this is because they take gender to be the deepest social cleavage and the most politically significant something that no other ideology has accepted or can accept
 for radical feminists patriarchal oppression can only be overthrown by a sexual revolution in which the structures of family personal and domestic life are overthrown and replaced
 amongst weaknesses are that it preaches individualism rather than sisterhood it is reformist rather than revolutionary and that it is usually concerned to uphold the divide rather than to overthrow it
 this is because for example it has often been more concerned about the than the and that its emphasis on the importance of the labour movement has tended to blur and conceal gender divisions
 nationalism in this view preaches that own nation is somehow or superior implying that other nations are less favoured or inferior
 such thinking is particularly evident in expansionist nationalism which is invariably based upon explicitly chauvinistic and sometimes racialist models of nationhood and in which the search for national glory is typically associated with projects of conquest and imperialism
 however progressive nationalists who draw on liberal or socialist thinking have rejected the idea that nationalism is inevitably linked to conflict and war
 instead they have often argued that nationalism may be the antidote to war and international rivalry as a world composed of will tend towards peace and harmony
 in this view the tendency towards war and expansion is a distortion of the principle of national not its logical consequence
 threshold level response will typically exhibit the following limited understanding of how nationalism does or does not breed conflict and war
 threshold level response will typically exhibit the following clear and accurate understanding of the way in which nationalism can lead or inevitably leads to conflict and war
 modernist or reformist ecologists have been inclined not to reject conventional moral thinking but to extend it to more adequately address environmental needs and concerns
 this can for instance be seen in a concern about future generations which extends the notion of human interests to encompass the human species as a whole making no difference between the present generation and future generations
 an alternative approach to morality is to apply ethical concepts conventionally related to human beings to other species notably in the case of animal rights
 threshold level response will typically exhibit the following limited understanding of the way in which ecologists do or do not go beyond conventional moral thinking
 threshold level response will typically exhibit the following clear and accurate understanding of the way in which ecologists go beyond conventional moral thinking

 consideration of the five precepts in relation to sila would be particularly relevant especially if applied to an ethical issue
 with regard to compassion candidates may discuss that metta or bhavana are developed through wisdom as well as karuna which is a readiness to give comfort sympathy concern and caring all are manifestations of compassion
 question mark scheme indicative content june marks guidance candidates might however consider whether this wisdom will be beneficial or harmful to society and link this to buddhist expectations
 candidates might argue that without certain adaptations then living as a member of the monastic sangha would be very difficult in the west and therefore adaptations actually make it easier to practise buddhism
 candidates might argue that these adaptations make it easier to practise buddhism in the west but only in such a way as to make adaptations of buddhism make it harder to follow in the discuss
 the question is asking whether or not the adaptations that have been made in the west have made buddhism in the traditional harder to follow
 it could then be argued that this in effect makes it harder to practise buddhism as the support structure which aids those in buddhist countries is missing
 some candidates may discuss the issue of lineage and that some western buddhists adaptations such as triratna have none which create a problem with authenticity and authority

 some candidates might suggest that these are not important or helpful and might in some cases lead to persecution examples might be which will hinder a believer in their worship possibly even preventing worship to take place

 candidates may consider some of the guru nanak felt that the life of a householder is the best institution to fulfil the ideal way sikhs can contribute to the development of human society
 most of the gurus were married with families and this was promoted over the alternative ascetic lifestyle of some religious believers of the time
 the rahit maryada states that a sikh should promote the family way of life giving time to children in an active way so as to ensure their proper awareness of the sikh way of life
 marriage ceremonies show that families intend to continue to follow a faith and it might be suggested that marriage is the best way to begin family life
 alternatively it guidance of family life in spiritual mark scheme mark scheme might be argued that a ceremony of marriage is symbolic and not essential for a couple to start family life
 funerals might be considered essential to provide comfort followers during their bereavement and offer hope that the dead are still a part of the faith

 d the bhagats whose bani of holy have been included in guru granth sahib belong to the period stretching from twelfth century to the seventeenth century when sikhism was still developing
 sikhs know that many of the bhagats were initially idol worshippers who studied and meditated before turning to the worship of one god they preached the oneness of god and exhorted the people to worship him alone
 very little is known about the lives of some of these bhagats but their contributions were recognised by guru arjan dev ji to be supportive of the beliefs and aspirations of the sikh faith as it developed
 the fact that these holy men changed their beliefs from idolatry to monotheism and then lived according to the teachings and beliefs of sikhism might encourage a sikh to follow their examples and become stronger in their faith
 they might also recognise that members of other faiths are welcomed into sikhism and that the notion of equality extends to those who become followers or who are holy in their own right
 candidates may consider some of the the guru granth sahib ji is considered to be a living guru and as such will be seen to be intrinsically relevant and helpful
 many sacred writings offer generic guidance which may or may not be adapted for situations in the century so they might be helpful
 examples might be given family life on how to perform worship on attitudes on how to conduct business which should reflect agreement or disagreement with the statement

 verbal answers in english the basic principle of assessment is that candidates should gain credit for what they know understand and can do
 however these aspects are an integral part of assessing communication and marks cannot be awarded where errors in spelling punctuation or grammar lead to a failure to communicate the required information without ambiguity
 where a candidate has given alternatives or additional information in answer the following criteria should be if the does not contradict the key idea or make it ambiguous if the contradicts the key idea or makes it ambiguous reject
 where numbered lines are given within a of a question credit should be given for correct answers no matter which line they appear on
 where a question has more than one section a candidate may include as part of the answer to one section the information required to answer another section
 in questions where candidates are asked to name for example three types of vegetable sold in the market only the first three items they write down should be considered
 if the rubric instructs them to write one letter or number in the box and they do so but write a second letter or number outside the box too then the answer in the box should be considered

 mark scheme june annotations annotation meaning blank page this annotation must be used on all blank pages within an answer booklet or and on each page of an additional object where there is no candidate response
 marking instructions handling of unexpected answers if you are not sure how to apply the mark scheme to an answer you should contact your team leader
 select and demonstrate clearly relevant knowledge and understanding through the use of evidence examples and correct language and terminology appropriate to the course of study
 in order to ensure the marking scheme can be and consistently and to examiners to mark in a standardised it defines levels of response by which answers are assessed
 this ensures that comparable standards are applied across the various units as well as within the team of examiners marking a particular unit
 levels of response are defined according to the two assessment in advanced subsidiary the questions are in two parts each addressing a single topic and targeted explicitly at one of the objectives
 in the marking scheme each question is provided with a brief outline of the likely content lines of argument of a answer but this is by no means prescriptive or exhaustive
 examiners must not attempt to reward answers according to the extent to which they match the structure of the outline or mention the points it contains
 the specification is designed to allow teachers to approach the content of modules in a variety of ways from any of a number of perspectives and answers must be assessed in the light of this flexibility of approach
 it is quite possible for an excellent and valid answer to contain knowledge and arguments which do not appear in the each answer must be assessed on its own merits according to the levels of response

 question mark scheme indicative content candidates may begin by explaining that utilitarianism is a consequential theory and perhaps explain the principle of utility from bentham
 they may also explain the preference utilitarianism of peter singer and how the preferences or interests of all those involved are to be considered
 question mark scheme indicative content candidates may discuss how utilitarians would apply the principle when considering the right to a child
 it is a valid approach for a candidate to discuss adoption without a specific focus on or other forms of fertility treatment
 once approach could be to look at how this issue may create rules or laws which benefit or harm society
 they may consider whether utilitarianism is best applied to issues surrounding the right to a child such as the age of the mother sexuality surrogacy etc
 candidates can make their assessment of utilitarianism from the internal strengths of the system and or the weaknesses or they might legitimately compare utilitarianism to another ethical theory
 however they may consider that utilitarianism is not the best approach as the consequences are not guaranteed and so the money may be better spent on other health services
 they may argue that another ethical approach such as natural law would give a clearer response and would protect the unused embryos from destruction
 candidates may explain that all pacifists see the killing of the innocent as morally unjustifiable and no matter what the consequences and many see the taking of human life as unjustified
 they may also explain that pacifist views are found across every christian explain the approaches of the religion you have studied to pacifism
 they may contrast this with just war theory and explain that christianity sees war as necessary as a final resort to protect innocent life
 candidates may discuss the approach of particular groups within christianity such as the quakers and some may discuss the influence of mainstream christians such as thomas merton and walter wink
 they may also consider that the old testament seems to justify war and that the new testament teaching is inconclusive and some teaching may only apply to individuals not to states
 this may lead into a discussion of what it means to be a true religious believer however this must relate to the general of the question on allowing war
 they may explain how the different formulations of the categorical imperative might be applied to the different ethical issues they have studied such as abortion euthanasia etc
 they may explain that the various formulations of the categorical imperative aim to enable the moral agent to know and fulfil duty
 again this is a valid approach however the response must clearly demonstrate an understanding of the formulations of the categorical imperative through their application if they do so
 candidates may not necessarily cover all three standard formulations of the categorical imperative and may refer to a variety of numbers of imperatives depending on their learning and the resources used
 good response may still be obtained by having dealt with two or more of the formulations showing depth of understanding of the application of the concepts
 question mark scheme indicative content candidates may agree with the question arguing that kantian ethics are and easy to apply
 the key term within the question is the concept of and as such the candidate should demonstrate this through their evaluation of the categorical imperative
 also candidates may consider that doing duty means that ethical decisions are not influenced by feelings and inclinations so that everyone is treated fairly
 on the other hand candidates may consider that theory is too rigid but does not tell us what to do in particular situations
 candidates may explain that moral relativism holds that moral truth varies depending on place culture time and religion and opposes absolutism which holds that moral truth is universal
 where ethical theories are used the candidates need to show how they can be considered to be relative otherwise they will be described without being relevant to the question
 candidate who responds using cultural relativism is producing a valid response to the question as there is no explicit demand for a demonstration of a normative ethical theory
 question mark scheme indicative content they may argue that relativist ethics allow different countries regions religions etc to make their own decisions about genetic engineering
 if a candidate makes a response using the issue of there must be an explicit link made to the modification or selection of genetic material within the embryo
 if this is not made explicit the response should be considered as not addressing the focus of the question although there may incidentally be some valid arguments made
 they may consider that without being completely absolutist there need to be some rules and guidelines when considering genetic engineering

 investigations assessing quality of written communication will have a bearing if the is inconsistent with the communication element of the descriptor for the level in which the answer falls
 level descriptor marks uncritical and descriptive presentation of mainly random information about the topic investigated demonstrating a minimal ability to identify and select material relevant to the communicated within a largely simplistic and unstructured framework
 the writing will show elements of coherence but there are likely to be passages which lack clarity proper organisation
 the candidate will demonstrate some of the skills needed to produce a convincing essay but there may be passages which show deficiencies in organisation
 occasional syntactical spelling errors may be found but they will not impede coherent deployment of the material and argument
 level descriptor marks mainly descriptive response at a general level to the raised in the expression of a point of view that is logically consistent with the task supported by reference to a simple argument or unstructured imprecisely expressed
 an accurate statement of the main raised by the task with some attempt to set out reasons for alternative a point of view expressed clearly supported by some relevant evidence and argument and deploying some technical language appropriately
 the candidate will demonstrate most of the skills needed to produce effective extended writing but there will be lapses in organisation
 an attempt at an evaluation of the raised in the task typically through a careful analysis of alternative leading to a clearly expressed viewpoint supported by evidence and reasoned expressed accurately fluently and using a range of technical vocabulary
 thus most candidates whose religious understanding related to a given question suggests that they should sit in a particular level will express that understanding in ways which broadly conform to the communication descriptor appropriate to that level
 indicators of written communication are best considered normatively and may be used to help decide a specific mark to be awarded within a level
 quality of written communication which fails to conform to the descriptor for the level will depress the award of marks by a within the level

 within a month and a half six other states from the deep south emboldened by south example had followed mississippi florida alabama georgia louisiana and texas
 unfortunately many in the south had persuaded themselves that slavery and a south dependent on slavery could only survive if slavery was extended into the territories
 with complete sincerity the south fought to preserve its version of the republic a government of limited powers that protected the rights of property
 its key supporters were the independent gentry and yeomanry of the white race undisturbed by large cities heartless factories restless free workers and class conflict
 the accession to power of the republican party with its ideology of competitive capitalism was a signal to the south that the northern majority had embraced this frightening revolutionary future
 the united states disunited sources for use with question david williams history of the civil war published the victory is often attributed to greater northern industry and population
 though it is true that the north had more factories and people than the south to assume that these were the overriding reasons for confederate defeat ignores more decisive realities of the battlefield and home front
 so successful was the munitions program that never did its forces lose a major battle for lack of war materiel
 had it not been for the of soldiers who were absent by the confederacy might well have been able to offset the population advantage

 investigations assessing quality of written communication will have a bearing if the is inconsistent with the communication element of the descriptor for the level in which the answer falls
 level descriptor marks uncritical and descriptive presentation of mainly random information about the topic investigated demonstrating a minimal ability to identify and select material relevant to the communicated within a largely simplistic and unstructured framework
 the writing will show elements of coherence but there are likely to be passages which lack clarity proper organisation
 the candidate will demonstrate some of the skills needed to produce a convincing essay but there may be passages which show deficiencies in organisation
 occasional syntactical spelling errors may be found but they will not impede coherent deployment of the material and argument
 level descriptor marks mainly descriptive response at a general level to the raised in the expression of a point of view that is logically consistent with the task supported by reference to a simple argument or unstructured imprecisely expressed
 an accurate statement of the main raised by the task with some attempt to set out reasons for alternative a point of view expressed clearly supported by some relevant evidence and argument and deploying some technical language appropriately
 the candidate will demonstrate most of the skills needed to produce effective extended writing but there will be lapses in organisation
 an attempt at an evaluation of the raised in the task typically through a careful analysis of alternative leading to a clearly expressed viewpoint supported by evidence and reasoned expressed accurately fluently and using a range of technical vocabulary
 thus most candidates whose religious understanding related to a given question suggests that they should sit in a particular level will express that understanding in ways which broadly conform to the communication descriptor appropriate to that level
 indicators of written communication are best considered normatively and may be used to help decide a specific mark to be awarded within a level
 quality of written communication which fails to conform to the descriptor for the level will depress the award of marks by a within the level

 decrease in price of sugar is likely to cause an increase in demand for tea so raising its price accept idea of little or no effect on the price of tea
 mark rejection marks option incorrect since no information on income is provided in the question rather the information concerns price and supply the question is not concerned with income elasticity of demand
 option incorrect since price elastic supply would require an answer above option incorrect since unit price elastic supply means the answer is where the percentage change in supply is equal to the percentage change in price
 price diagram pe tax area qe quantity rejection marks option incorrect since an outward shift of the supply curve would be the result of a subsidy
 option incorrect since this is the effect of a specific tax which causes a parallel shift in the supply curve a specific tax is imposed as a fixed amount per unit of good

 option incorrect since the agency will buy and add to its stockpile as there is an excess supply agency will only sell from stockpile when there is a poor harvest
 option incorrect since for price to increase to there has to be a poor harvest below original output there is an excess demand
 to diversify energy the economy becomes less reliant on fossil fuels less dependent on imports of fossil fuels long term price of fossil fuels likely to rise as they run out

 output consumer goods output capital goods evaluation or or discussion of impact on fishing and tourist industries and how their output might be affected
 discussion of magnitude of just of energy needs so may not have massive impact discussion of the significance of jobs created to the local or national economy
 accept idea of an opportunity cost to the tidal barrage this may be referred to in a movement along the curve
 unemployed resources may be used up and so increasing output closer to its production possibility potential rather than cause a shift the curve outwards so that it is closer to full employment level of output
 discussion of time it may take many years to build but the impact is likely to be over years many of the jobs created may be short term
 discussion of the overseas funding suggests income stream from the project will go abroad accept macro arguments on impact on trade balance
 discussion that there might be no change to the production possibility frontier since renewable energy is just replacing energy power stations
 the wage rate or as the wage rate rises then so too will the supply of labour since greater financial incentive to work longer hours
 net advantages in construction of the tidal these may include bonuses possible dangerous working conditions sick pay and paid holidays job satisfaction job security
 government social security cuts in the job allowance and housing benefits may increase incentive to work or supply of labour especially for low skilled areas of construction work
 reference to the national minimum an increase in may raise incentive to work so more supply of labour the raising of school leaving age or retirement it may increase supply of labour for the project
 net migration inflows to membership of the single european market has increased net migration flow of labour to trade unions may affect rate of pay or other working conditions e
 availability and rental price of local housing likely to be very important compared to a change in geographical mobility of labour

 regulations on the consumption of tobacco examples include a ban on smoking in enclosed public places and work places such as shops and restaurants increase in age of buying tobacco from to years
 explanation of price inelastic demand percentage change in demand is less than the percentage change in or numerical for example a rise in price of tobacco might cause a fall in demand
 reference to extract demand for tobacco smoking is likely to be price inelastic since total expenditure has increased following a price rise use of data e
 discussion of smoking statistic for teenagers expect increases in tax to cause reduction in smoking rates as typically they have low incomes
 a large drop in tobacco smoking from to of adult population between and price elasticity of demand may vary between countries development with use of an example
 discussion on the reliability of the information provided development of this point it is from the antismoking pressure group the data might not include influence of smuggling
 national health service should benefit from treating fewer smoking related patients the billion cost should fall divert resources to other areas of health care more tax revenue from people in work possible to raise retirement age
 extract mentions more than pubs closing down and linked to smoking ban in enclosed public places loss of direct taxation revenue and possible higher spending on benefits
 government may lose tax revenue over time it was billion from indirect taxes on tobacco in government spending may increase on the ageing population as live longer such as state pensions and costs
 discussion of time period or figure indicates there is a long term trend of the decline in smoking and indicates it may take a further years to eliminate smoking
 discussion of the reduction in smoking is not so successful among manual workers a persistent proportion of year olds still smoke
 questioning the accuracy of the estimates on the costs of tobacco smoking to society tobacco smuggling could exaggerate the fall in tobacco smoking the benefits from reduction in smoking may be exaggerated
 the quality of written communication will be assessed in this question based on the to present an argument and conclude on the basis of that argument
 high tobacco taxes may not be significant cause of tobacco smuggling spain and italy have much lower tobacco taxes but higher rates of smuggling
 the quality of written communication will be assessed in this question based on the to present an argument and conclude on the basis of that argument

 this was a consequence of a belief in the ascendancy of the german in the validity of war as an instrument of policy and in the decisiveness of power politics in international relations
 the main impediment to war was effectively removed when russia became principal enemy during the winter of in place of france
 ian porter and ian armour imperial germany published the argument of suggests that the bethmann hollweg government deliberately provoked a diplomatic crisis which it knew might lead to war
 but it made no sense except in terms of a vast of the arms race since and also in terms of a new radical nationalism that had arisen in the same period
 in the great powers that process occurred in an atmosphere of increasing hysteria since germany represented the most advanced case of this radical nationalism and hysteria
 from kaiser to germany sources for use with question michael burleigh the third reich published faith in the führer became a mass phenomenon
 this was an unsurprising reaction in a divided country where many felt their existence threatened by a succession of crises
 contrary to any rational understanding of how a dictatorial party works people believed in a führer presiding over an army of little hitlers of whom they were fully prepared to think the worst
 thus the murders of late june were widely approved of or tolerated on the grounds that the führer had purged decadent homosexuals
 ian kershaw the hitler image and reality in the third reich published discontent about social and economic conditions was perfectly compatible with the recognition of other of the regime in particular those attributable to hitler himself
 much of this discontent particularly from within the working class was presumably expressed by those who had never been wholly won over to nazism
 however everyday grievances based on material dissatisfaction important though they were in forming popular attitudes by no means necessarily signified total rejection of nazism or the führer
 nikolaus wachsmann policy of repression in the nazi state in jane caplan nazi germany published at the end of june there were some political prisoners
 by contrast there were only a handful of concentration camps at this point with around inmates not all of them political prisoners
 meanwhile as the german police made greater use of their powers to detain suspects the result was an increase in the number of political prisoners inside camps
 among them were numerous convicts rearrested on their release from prison a practice widely supported by the legal authorities
 but unlike in the early nazi camps these inmates wearing the red triangle on their uniforms were often now outnumbered by other victims of nazi repression
 britain and the challenge of saving europe at a sources for use with question anthony adamthwaite the making of the second world war published from late hitler set germany on a course of territorial expansion in central europe
 it was only after annexation of rump czechoslovakia in march that britain and france began to consider stopping him by force
 by encouraging hitler to think that his territorial ambitions would not be opposed appeasement contributed to the making of the second world war
 although appeasement was not merely the personal policy of neville chamberlain the offer of a colonial settlement to germany in march and the dismemberment of czechoslovakia in september were the main instances of his misjudgement
 richard overy the origins of the second world war published the munich agreement represented a realistic assessment of the balance between western interests and western capabilities
 that something vital had been at stake in the czech crisis was not immediately obvious in when chamberlain was universally hailed as the saviour of peace
 this fact above all persuaded chamberlain that the prospect of a general settlement was not yet beyond his grasp
 the lively and continuing debate over the wisdom of british appeasement has largely missed the point of the crisis over czechoslovakia by assuming that it was chamberlain rather than hitler who decided against war
 yet the evidence we have suggests that hitler like his generals recognised in that he could not yet fight britain and france
 furthermore plans for radical industrial reform were blunted by opposition from industrialists with whom the government needed to keep good relations in order to accelerate peacetime production and exploit head start over its continental rivals
 lloyd empire welfare state english history published because germany and japan were too shattered by the war to compete england had an excellent opportunity to secure new export markets
 it has been suggested that the demand for their goods was so strong in these years that they fell into bad habits and assumed that the customer would put up with anything
 as a result when the germans and the japanese returned to world markets they did not find it too hard to win customers away from the british
 strikes remained illegal under wartime regulations rationing and many physical controls stayed in force to restrain consumption and direct investment interest rates were kept at and the trade unions accepted wage restraint

 candidates might consider some of the the murti provides a focus for worship and prayer and so makes it easier to concentrate
 psychologically it is easier to accept that god is listening and caring if you can see an object for your worship
 by making offerings to the murti and treating it as a beloved guest it is possible to demonstrate love and devotion to god in a physical way
 murtis provide a reminder of the stories and attributes of particular deities and so by extension can remind a hindu about the qualities of god which should be adored emulated
 for example using a murti of ganesh as an object of worship or meditation can remind a hindu of the love and generosity of god and of the importance of learning and intelligence
 for this reason the presence of a consecrated murti in the home can bring particular blessings into the home and turn the home into a holy place
 some may describe the teachings of reform movements within hinduism that have sought to move away from murti worship
 also if there is a god then communication with god must surely be the most important thing you can do
 certain prayers are only known and recited by priests and it surely follows that these ritual words have great power
 against the statement it could be argued that there are many ways of understanding the divine in hinduism not all of which involve belief in a personal god
 many agnostics and even atheists practise meditation and benefit from it so it could clearly be argued that it is of wider benefit than prayer
 some hindus might suggest that praying to the divinities encourages maya as it holds the person back from realising not only that the individual deities are in fact but also that they themselves are identical with brahman
 other candidates might suggest that since both are required by the scriptures and ritual in the samhitas and meditation in the both must be necessary and they must complement each other
 responses might it is the law of cause or effect the actions you carry out bring good or bad karma it is a law of the universe phala
 they are also important in as much as they show that a hindu guidance question mark scheme answer is complying with instructions laid down in the vedas and other scriptures and so living as a good hindu
 june mark samskaras also form a bond and a sense of belonging with the local community and so show place within the wider scheme of varnashramadharma
 for example the mundan is concerned with the removal of bad karma from a previous life in order to make an auspicious beginning
 the samskaras connected with marriage and funerals also show beliefs about the importance of marriage and the family and the roles of men and women and about life after death and candidates may discuss these in detail
 however elaborate or enjoyable the ceremony is it only lasts for a short time hindu culture up to a as opposed to the marriage which will last a lifetime
 putting too much emphasis on the wedding can lead to a sense of anti climax which is not a good start to married life
 each ritual point has a spiritual meaning that can be of help to the couple in their life together and the candidates may describe these symbolic meanings in detail
 june mark guidance the money spent on the wedding is a display of wealth which may help to strengthen family ties
 this helps to ensure that it is taken seriously and that the wedding becomes a time that the couple can look back on for inspiration and hope when things get difficult
 the importance of the bride and groom and in particular the importance of their role as parents is also emphasised by the clothes they wear which are reminiscent of royalty
 the upanishads are not overly concerned with individual deities or with the formulaic ritual of the however they do teach that knowledge of the vedas which they mean the samhitas and is vital
 in some forms of hinduism study of the upanishads is limited to the or the top three varnas and this indicated the importance of the upanishads to hindus
 candidates might also suggest that the upanishads are not all that important as most hindus whilst holding them in high regard have never actually read them and that they are not well known outside the circles of academia
 it could be argued that the upanishads have greater importance to academics and to the way in which hinduism has developed and come to be understood outside india
 sruti scriptures have a special status as which is meaning that they are believed to be direct revelations from the divine
 one of the key duties of the brahmins is to learn and understand the sruti texts so that they can use that knowledge to serve the wider community
 the writings are considered so holy that in many circles reading them is forbidden to certain members of society
 other sacred writings do not have these qualities and so could be seen as being of far less importance
 for this reason it could be said that they have had far more influence on hinduism than the vedic texts which have great theoretical importance but little practical application
 if a script has a scribe cover sheet it is vital to check which boxes are ticked and award as per the instructions and grid i
 the initial assessment must be made as if the candidate had not used a scribe word and was eligible for all the spag marks
 check the cover sheet to see what has been dictated what facilities were disabled on the word and therefore what proportion of marks is available to the candidate
 if a script has a word processor cover sheet attached to it the candidate can still access spag marks point a
 if you come across a typewritten script without a cover sheet please check with the special requirements team at who can check what access arrangements were agreed
 if the script has a transcript oral language modifier sign language interpreter or a practical assistant cover sheet award spag as normal

 assessing quality of written communication will have a bearing if the is inconsistent with the communication element of the descriptor for the level in which the answer falls
 the candidate will demonstrate some of the skills needed to produce a convincing essay but there may be passages which show deficiencies in organisation
 occasional syntactical spelling errors may be found but they will not impede coherent deployment of the material and argument
 the candidate will demonstrate most of the skills needed to produce effective extended writing but there will be lapses in organisation
 thus most candidates whose religious understanding related to a given question suggests that they should sit in a particular level will express that understanding in ways which broadly conform to the communication descriptor appropriate to that level
 indicators of written communication are best considered normatively and may be used to help decide a specific mark to be awarded within a level
 quality of written communication which fails to conform to the descriptor for the level will depress the award of marks by a within the level

 mark schemes are prepared by the principal examiner and considered together with the relevant questions by a panel of subject teachers
 this mark scheme includes any amendments made at the standardisation events which all examiners participate in and is the scheme which was used by them in this examination
 the standardisation process ensures that the mark scheme covers the responses to questions and that every examiner understands and applies it in the same correct way
 as preparation for standardisation each examiner analyses a number of alternative answers not already covered by the mark scheme are discussed and legislated for
 if after the standardisation process examiners encounter unusual answers which have not been raised they are required to refer these to the principal examiner
 it must be stressed that a mark scheme is a working document in many cases further developed and expanded on the basis of reactions to a particular paper
 assumptions about future mark schemes on the basis of one document should be whilst the guiding principles of assessment remain constant details will change depending on the content of a particular examination paper
 verbal answers in english the basic principle of assessment is that candidates should gain credit for what they know understand and can do
 however these aspects are an integral part of assessing communication and marks cannot be awarded where errors in spelling punctuation or grammar lead to a failure to communicate the required information without ambiguity
 where a candidate has given alternatives or additional information in answer the following criteria should be if the does not contradict the key idea or make it ambiguous if the contradicts the key idea or makes it ambiguous reject
 where numbered lines are given within a of a question credit should be given for correct answers no matter which line they appear on
 where a question has more than one section a candidate may include as part of the answer to one section the information required to answer another section
 in questions where candidates are asked to name for example three types of vegetable sold in the market only the first three items they write down should be considered
 if the rubric instructs them to write one letter or number in the box and they do so but write a second letter or number outside the box too then the answer in the box should be considered
 tout court where a candidate has crossed out an answer and what was underneath remains legible then it should be assessed
 where a candidate spells the answer in such a way that it is a word in the target language no credit can be awarded
 if a candidate offers two different responses in english or in the target language eg dog or dog where the answer is dog no credit can be awarded

 the priest has acres of arable land which was worth pence a year on average in the years before the pestilence and is now worth pence a year
 the altar dues and tithe of wool and lambs were worth shillings and pence in an average year before the pestilence and are now worth shillings and pence
 from a government document assessing the value of church property offered to the king by a monastery source numbers of people in some cistercian monasteries in yorkshire
 during the fifteenth century and on into the first decades of the sixteenth there was a general and notable increase in numbers in all english religious houses
 the burden of debts is therefore insupportable so the monks now need to transfer their possessions to satisfy their creditors and will lose them for ever
 the resources are not adequate to maintain the required hospitality or for works of charity or for the fitting support of those worshipping god within the monastery or the payment of their servants
 the commons have properly brought their complaints to us and experience also tells us that priests of the present day do not look after the souls of the people
 these priests do not realise that divine intervention spared them from the pestilence not for their own merits but so that they could perform the ministry for people
 they apply themselves instead to the celebration of commemorative and for these too they are not content with the payment of adequate wages but demand excessive salaries for their services
 wishing therefore to control this insatiable desire on the part of priests we order and urge you to ensure that every priest performing religious services in your diocese accepts a moderate salary

 hoped my lord leicester and especially lord burghley with his wise judgement had by this time been blessed with godly inspiration to have influence on the queen and would bring her majesty to the truth but was deceived
 the lords chief judges know that the thought of treason towards the queen is death and he that is guilty of rebellion is guilty by intent of seeking the destruction of the queen and therefore is guilty of treason
 he who assembles troops if the queen commands him as a loyal subject to dissolve his troops but he continues without any question it is high treason
 then this must be higher than the highest and he who arms himself against the power must necessarily be within the bounds of treason
 the most traitorous aims have been and some of these associations have been supposed to have actually adopted measures of such a nature and to have gone to such excesses as will amount to the crime of high treason

 the thought that the output gap needed to be closed and was concerned that fiscal tightening might have a long term impact on the productive potential of the economy
 the government responded to this assessment of its economic policy by saying that expansionary policies should not conflict with the objectives of reducing the budget deficit and national debt
 despite latvia operating a fixed exchange rate against the euro the claimed that latvia had been able to restore its international competitiveness through cutting wages and prices
 fiscal austerity had helped achieve this improved international competitiveness through large cuts in public sector wages and the deflationary consequences of fiscal tightening on the private sector
 its exchange rate had depreciated by since the end of nevertheless the was strong in its support of intention to adopt the euro
 the united nations conference on trade and development expressed a view that fiscal austerity in developed economies would put at risk the gains in economic development in the developing world through its impact on international trade
 despite this there were some concerns about the extent to which economic development in such economies could be promoted solely by a reliance on international trade
 officials from the conduct a detailed analysis and then make forecasts of economic performance which are followed by discussions with a government and central bank
 encouragingly labour market performance has been better with fewer employment losses than in the aftermath of previous major recessions
 despite the projected modest increase in growth in the second half of the output gap is projected to remain sizeable for an extended period raising the risk of hysteresis as sustained cyclical weakness may reduce the future productive capacity
 inflation has been on a downward trend since peaking in september this trend will continue as the large output gap exerts disinflationary pressure
 another risk is that the adverse impact of measures to reduce public and private sector debt may be even larger than expected and the anticipated rebalancing of demand is even slower to materialise
 it needs to be recognised that policy options in this regard come with risks including uncertainty about their effectiveness
 however these risks need to be weighed against that of weak demand leading to long run slow growth high unemployment and a negative impact on consumer and investor confidence
 weak nominal wage growth and broadly stable inflation expectations suggest underlying inflationary pressure is weak providing space for a more expansionary monetary policy
 for example cuts in spending on items such as public employee wages could be used to finance higher spending on items such as infrastructure
 selected fiscal and monetary policy recommendations for the the annual assessment of the economic situation reignited debate about the effectiveness of the coalition deficit reduction plan
 britain has to deal with its debts and the fiscal policy is the appropriate one and an essential part of our road to recovery
 others doubted the reliability of the estimates of pointing out that unemployment continued to fall tax revenues were increasing and that business surveys showed rising rather than falling economic activity
 they argued that the government should not be distracted from its commitment to reduce the budget deficit and national debt
 the head of the organisation for economic and development angel gurria echoed the assessment of the that measures to promote growth should concentrate on balanced budget fiscal expansion
 this compares the change in from the start of the recession with the next most recent recession and what is considered to be the worst recession percentage change from start of recession months from start of recession onwards fig
 comparison of the change in in three recessions the case for more fiscal and monetary stimulus would be a strong one if the output gap was large
 this financial assistance was supplemented by loans from the european union the world bank and several nordic countries to provide a package totalling billion
 the latvian currency the lat had come under pressure as a result of a current account deficit on the balance of payments of almost of in this deficit was financed by increasing levels of private sector external debt
 very high wage growth far in excess of productivity growth had severely undermined international competitiveness and contributed to the large external imbalances
 in exchange for financial assistance from the and other lenders latvia agreed to a package of policy large cuts in public sector wages substantial tightening of fiscal policy structural reforms to raise international competitiveness
 staff visited latvia in may as part of its surveillance role in order to monitor the outcome of its programme of assistance and the policy measures adopted by the country
 joining the euro would be beneficial for the latvian the assessment of the outcome of its programme of assistance and the policy measures adopted by latvia were held up as examples of the success of fiscal austerity measures
 latvia is one of four economies known as the bells estonia latvia and which adopted and stuck to a fixed currency peg with the euro and have been regarded as success stories of fiscal austerity
 she praised the latvian economic policy as a that serve as an inspiration for european leaders grappling with the euro fig
 it is a great pleasure to be here today in this beautiful city of riga to celebrate the remarkable achievements of latvia over the past few years
 it lost a fifth of its output in just two years and unemployment rose to almost and double this rate among young people
 you have returned to strong growth and reduced unemployment even if it remains far too high at around you have lowered budget deficits and kept government debt ratios to some of the lowest in the european union
 how did you do if we want to single out one factor for latvia it would be its impressive determination
 this had a number of instead of spreading the pain over many years the country stood together and did what needed to be done up front
 the achievement was incredibly impressive in the first year of its programme latvia implemented fiscal adjustment of more than of total adjustment for the whole programme is even higher at around of latvia also had a clear euro adoption
 speaking for the am proud to have been part of success story alongside our european commission and nordic partners
 high levels of private sector indebtedness remain in latvia and as a result growth in both investment and consumer expenditure remain weak fig
 whether latvia can sustain economic growth solely from exports depends not only on the growth in world trade but also on international competitiveness
 in addition for reductions in unit labour costs to be sustained there needs to be improvements in productivity as well as a reduction in nominal wages
 latvia was more dependent on a change in its real effective exchange rate which depreciated by around measured in terms of unit labour costs
 in a policy brief published in december stated fragile global economy has a significant interest in the implementation of expansionary rather than contractionary fiscal policies in key economies
 between and the commodity exports had grown in total by but exports of commodities to europe had only grown by exhaustible natural resources account for a large share of output and export earnings in many countries
 major natural resource exports in africa rising world commodity prices coupled with new resource discoveries have stimulated growth in these economies during the past decade
 strong output growth following the discovery of natural resources changed the composition of output quite markedly among resource exporters but the effect on the composition of employment has been modest
 in part this reflected the normally nature of resource production but it also indicated the emergence of a sharply dualistic economic structure in which sectors as agriculture and many remained largely untransformed

 examiners should also be prepared to award zero marks if the response is not worthy of credit according to the mark scheme
 where some judgement is required mark schemes will provide the principles by which marks will be awarded and exemplification may be limited
 when examiners are in doubt regarding the application of the mark scheme to a response the team leader must be consulted
 history marking guidance marking of levels of response the mark scheme provides an indication of the sorts of answer that might be found at different levels
 it is intended as a guide and it will be necessary therefore for examiners to use their professional judgement in deciding both at which level a question has been answered and how effectively points have been sustained
 candidates should always be rewarded according to the quality of thought expressed in their answer and not solely according to the amount of knowledge conveyed
 however candidates with only a superficial knowledge will be unable to develop or sustain points sufficiently to move to higher levels
 at the end of each answer examiners should look back on the answer as a whole in the light of these general criteria in order to ensure that the total mark reflects their overall impression of the worth
 deciding on the mark point within a level the first stage is to decide the overall level and then whether the work represents high mid or low performance within the level
 one stronger passage at level would not by itself merit a level award but it would be evidence to support a high level award unless there were also substantial weaknesses in other areas
 assessing quality of written communication qowc will have a bearing if the qowc is inconsistent with the communication descriptor for the level in which the answer falls
 if for example a history response displays mid level criteria but fits the level qowc descriptors it will require a move down within the level
 these will be supported by limited factual material which has some accuracy and relevance although not directed at the focus of the question
 they will however include material which is either descriptive and thus only implicitly relevant to the focus or which strays from that focus
 candidates offer an analytical response which relates well to the focus of the question and which shows some understanding of the key issues contained in it
 the candidate will demonstrate the skills needed to produce convincing extended writing but there may be passages which lack clarity or coherence
 candidates offer an analytical response which directly addresses the focus of the question and which demonstrates explicit understanding of the key issues contained in it
 mid level marks as per descriptor high level marks the qualities of level are securely material is convincing in range and depth consistent with level the exposition will be controlled and the deployment logical
 thus most candidates whose historical understanding related to a given question suggests that they should sit in a particular level will express that understanding in ways which broadly conform to the communication descriptor appropriate to that level
 indicators of written communication are best considered normatively and may be used to help decide a specific mark to be awarded within a level
 quality of written communication which fails to conform to the descriptor for the level will depress the award of marks by a within the level
 during this period the british were able to eliminate the threat of dutch rivalry and limit the extent of the french and the lesser portuguese interest in india

 fear of the consequences of slave revolt and participation in the napoleonic wars also led to reluctance from parliament to support the full abolition of slavery

 responses might suggest that much of the consequent consolidation of company rule and expansion of british control across the whole time period was directly related to the need to secure these gains
 until the french remained a threat and the british became increasing worried about the security of the frontier which acted as a buffer to advances on india from the north
 despite having gained the ascendency the british also needed to secure their gains from internal rebellion and attack from indigenous indian states
 there were continuous attempts to reform and consolidate rule within company territory and various expanded territory in attempts to control the ruler of mysore the maharattas and ranjit singh
 to establish extent candidates might compare the given factor with other influences suggest the primacy of a different motivational factor or consider changing influences over time
 other motivational influences that might be considered are the desire for economic profit the desire to reform the aims of individuals external threats and the defence of british prestige
 some candidates might suggest that rather than just defending the gains made the power vacuum created by the defeat in some regions of india also led the british to establish more formal control
 these answers will establish arguments in a broadly balanced response while the best may attempt to evaluate or integrate the factors into an overall judgement

 by the east india company was more of a political rather than economic force and the concept of the raj had been established
 most of the major resistance to british power particularly in mysore and from the marathas had been overcome by with the punjab being the only surviving indian state in a position to resist
 however responses might counter the extent to which there was direct control with reference to the nature of power in the indian subcontinent
 it was not the desire of either the british government or the company to be in direct control of the entire subcontinent as this would have been very expensive
 the aim was for the company to control directly the areas which brought greatest profit required security and to rely on exploiting indirect control through indian rulers to maintain stability in other areas
 the british government had no direct control although it regulated the actions of the company and supplied some of the military resources required to police the subcontinent
 candidates will probably refer mainly to the aspects of political administrative and economic control mentioned above but may also refer to cultural controls as well
 these answers will establish extent of change in a broadly balanced response while the best may attempt to evaluate or integrate the factors into an overall judgement

 both geographical areas should be considered at level and above but it is not expected that they will be addressed equally
 in asia where british influence was either informal or major alternative religions already existed the influence of missionaries was less significant
 to establish the extent to which missionary activity was significant candidates might compare the given factor with other factors suggest the primacy of a different factor or consider changing influences over time
 some responses might suggest that the influence of christian missionary activity in both areas was weak and that other influences such as trade prestige influences settler politics and british political attitudes were more important
 these answers will establish arguments in a broadly balanced response while the best may attempt to evaluate or integrate the factors into an overall judgement
 level answers will attempt analysis with some understanding of the focus of the question possibly by explaining the influence of christian missionaries or by reference to only one geographical area

 number indicative content mark the question is focused on the desire of african nationalists to achieve majority rule for and the reasons why it took so long to achieve
 by the time most colonies had gained independence in the situation had still not been resolved mainly due to the presence of a significant white minority population
 reasons which might be suggested may focus on the weaknesses of the nationalists the strengths of the white rhodesian government geographical and external factors
 although initially united the nationalists split into different political and later armed groups each supported by different ethnic and social groups and by different external countries
 the white minority government was supported by an effective system of social control a strong determination to remain in power and by the white south african government
 with the british colonial power unable and apparently unwilling to intervene in a county external interests played a major part in the continuing civil war which ensued
 for example it was really only after the portuguese withdrawal from africa in that the white rhodesian government began to be adversely affected by a lack of access to vital resources
 some candidates might suggest that it was only when the external situation began to change that the conflict was brought to an end as south african influence waned and britain became more willing to intervene
 these answers will provide a broadly balanced response while the best may attempt to evaluate or integrate the factors into an overall judgement
 level answers will attempt analysis with some understanding of the focus of the question possibly outlining a limited number of factors explaining the course of the nationalist fight for independence

 registered company number with its registered office at edinburgh gate harlow essex mark schemes are prepared by the principal examiner and considered together with the relevant questions by a panel of subject teachers
 this mark scheme includes any amendments made at the standardisation meeting attended by all examiners and is the scheme which was used by them in this examination
 the standardisation meeting ensures that the mark scheme covers the responses to questions and that every examiner understands and applies it in the same correct way
 as preparation for the standardisation meeting each examiner analyses a number of alternative answers not already covered by the mark scheme are discussed at the meeting and legislated for
 if after this meeting examiners encounter unusual answers which have not been discussed at the meeting they are required to refer these to the principal examiner
 it must be stressed that a mark scheme is a working document in many cases further developed and expanded on the basis of reactions to a particular paper
 assumptions about future mark schemes on the basis of one document should be whilst the guiding principles of assessment remain constant details will change depending on the content of a particular examination paper
 verbal answers in english the basic principle of assessment is that candidates should gain credit for what they know understand and can do
 however these aspects are an integral part of assessing communication and marks cannot be awarded where errors in spelling punctuation or grammar lead to a failure to communicate the required information without ambiguity
 where a candidate has given alternatives or additional information in answer the following criteria should be if the does not contradict the key idea or make it ambiguous if the contradicts the key idea or makes it ambiguous reject
 where numbered lines are given within a of a question credit should be given for correct answers no matter which line they appear on
 where a question has more than one section a candidate may include as part of the answer to one section the information required to answer another section
 in questions where candidates are asked to name for example three types of vegetable sold in the market only the first three items they write down should be considered
 if the rubric instructs them to write one letter or number in the box and they do so but write a second letter or number outside the box too then the answer in the box should be considered

 the marking schemes which follow were those used by for the summer examination in they were finalised after detailed discussion at conferences by all the examiners involved in the assessment
 the conferences were held shortly after the papers were taken so that reference could be made to the full range of responses with photocopied scripts forming the basis of discussion
 the aim of the conferences was to ensure that the marking schemes were interpreted and applied in the same way by all examiners
 some candidates may approach short term from the view of change that is in the form of years and review el niño whilst others may approach short term from a geological angle and address fluctuations over the last years
 other approaches may address climate change induced by volcanic activity and recent climate change seen as a result of human induced global warming
 both of these elements need to be addressed to access level descriptions of climate change will vary with the example selected
 in the case of el niño comment may be made on changing patterns of rainfall temperature storm activity and drought
 those that review climatic change over the past years may examine the characteristics of the medieval warm period the little ice age
 detail here may look at temperature and precipitation patterns over hundreds of years and thus be more general in character than accounts of more recent change
 some answers may address single events such as droughts associated with el niño events but these need to be linked to overall change
 these answers may provide detail of the changing climate which results from this increase in the form of temperature precipitation and extreme weather events
 the material presented as impacts will vary according to the society or societies chosen but there will be some common elements such as economy work migration disease traditions etc
 good answers should display depth of knowledge of the link between the effects of climate change and the impacts on selected elements of society
 for example answers may refer to sea level change which may cause migration and this could be described in some detail
 the table also shows that higher income countries have a higher percentage of events that result in than the opposite is true of low income countries
 earthquakes that resulted in no deaths are in mics hics are earthquakes that resulted in no deaths are in mics and lower in at compare local and regional impacts of one or more tectonic events
 answers will probably look at the local element in the form of impacts that are found in the area surrounding the epicentre of an earthquake or the area adjacent to the volcanic eruption
 for instance the economic impacts can have a broader scale kobe had an impact in the eastern asian region as did the sendai earthquake and tsunami
 be prepared to look at impacts from the view of the aid that is generated in response to hazard aid came from the and other caribbean countries as a response to the haitian earthquake
 accept answers that approach the question through an examination of a single case study as well as those that choose to refer to a number of examples to illustrate each element of the question
 candidates that give a detailed review of the impacts without covering the required scales or comparison should be confined to level level marks good knowledge and understanding of impacts at both scales
 there will be a great variety of strategies used depending on the selected and the examples that have been studied
 the focus of the question is outline so expect to see answers that describe the identified strategy and how it manages the hazard
 the management may refer to how the strategy allows people to avoid the hazard to absorb the impacts of the hazard or to alleviate the impacts of the hazard after it has occurred
 popular strategies that may be used building engineering earthquake preparedness household seismic safety seismic retrofit education for citizens emergency service training evacuation for tsunamis plans aid and earthquake prediction
 strategies may include the use of dykes washlands arrangements of rooms in housing next to rivers evacuation afforestation specific aid projects etc
 accept a broad interpretation of economic but do not credit impacts that are firmly in the realms of social demographic or physical
 in the planning stage there could be reference to a number of uses the establishment of the suitability of the area for study for risk assessment and for the establishment of sampling procedure and sites
 candidates may discuss the information that is available on maps such as height slope vegetation and the amount of settlement
 the quality of the answers will depend upon the nature of the outline which could be one use of maps developed in detail or a variety of uses in less detail but giving a broader understanding
 the question is looking for the main conclusions and the better answers will refer to the outcomes of the investigation in relation to the original question issue or hypothesis set by the candidate or centre
 some will develop the assessment of the results in relation to the original hypothesis in detail and this is a valid approach
 objectives grid for geography knowledge and understanding application skills total key question question question question using the mark bands the aim is to find the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained by the candidate using the model

 characteristics of migration may include some of the age selective sex selective race selective religion selective wealth selective involve few people or millions occur over a variety of distances e
 any two types of migration at any scale can qualify as a correct answer with differences between them emphasised thus qualifying for higher credit

 answers that focus entirely on how fringe changes have had an impact elsewhere away from the fringe in the for example
 the question asks for impacts and a review of changes themselves would not be sufficient for level some suggested changes and impacts in the fringe
 demographic change in numbers and the nature of people living in fringe settlements may impact by inducing tension between different locals and newcomers young and old
 out of town developments in retailing office parks leisure and recreation centres golf courses impact by creating a busier environment with more journeys on narrow rural roads with safety issues and associated traffic congestion and vehicle pollution
 decline in agricultural land use impacts by creating derelict and abandoned farms which some perceive as unsightly whilst other celebrate the newly colonising biodiversity which follows
 as cbds lost many retail entertainment shopping and office businesses to out of town developments a was empty shops some dereliction unkempt and untidy and a preponderance of charity shops
 environmental improvements have been great with large expansions of traffic free areas street repaving fancy lighting flowers fountains hanging baskets etc
 apartments are often included in redevelopment schemes which draw back residents to city centres and hence more and convenient custom for retailers
 the more wealthy and aspirational may be drawn to locate within the catchment area of what is perceived to be a suitable school
 environmental people wishing to reduce their costs and time may wish to live nearer the inner city to be closer to business shops and entertainment
 newer housing accretions may be occupied by a variety of different types of second homers council tenants housing association tenants exclusive private estates
 communication routes can often pull settlements out along these routes with the more accessible route attracting better types of housing
 the only real benefit of the map is that it names some features and picks out the water areas very well
 answers only need to cover the advantages of aerial photographs but some reference to the map is necessary in order to justify those advantages
 advantages of using the aerial photograph rather than the individual fields can be seen in the and east perhaps to enable recognition of either pasture or arable land
 in the residential areas there are more rectangular roads in the corner indicating perhaps an older development than the more curved and haphazard residential road pattern to the east of the rectangular pattern
 roads can be clearly distinguished and their importance can be seen by their a dual carriageway runs west to east in the middle of the photograph
 the age sex and ethnicity of respondents questions should be written with alternative answers and for speed and ease of collection and subsequent analysis of data
 an outline of what the investigation set out to achieve would be expected with a review of whether or not the initial hypothesis question issue had been realised
 some candidates may incorporate an evaluation as part of their conclusion as this is listed as part of stage and in document enquiry approach which can be applied to and which can be found on the geography web page

 this means that there are a number of possible you need to give the main ones and then say which you tend to favour
 discuss usually you are expected to build up an argument about an issue and to present more than one side of the evidence with supporting examples
 to what extent how far do you agree examine give possible explanations for and against and justify which you tend to favour investigate in detail offering evidence for or against a point of view or judgement
 summary descriptor very good marks out of criteria good average marginal weak response that demonstrates a high order of conceptual understanding and an appreciation of the holistic nature of geography within the context of the question
 arguments are weakly presented and most points are generalised or of partial relevance to the question with little or no linkage
 if a candidate answers in a way that is not anticipated by the mark scheme but has an acceptable answer to the question set please use the generic mark scheme to determine an appropriate mark
 indicative content in relation to desert environments candidates may examine the threats posed by population growth agriculture tourism and mineral exploitation
 comment could be made on the role of agriculture in desertification at a continental scale the pollution of soils and ecosystems by mineral exploitation such as that in australia or the damage caused by in dubai
 when discussing the strategies used to manage human activity candidates may present a range from conserving the desert environment alleviating the impacts of human activity controlling the use of desert environments and monitoring the impacts of human activity
 candidates may display a grasp of a number of these but do not expect all to be considered as candidates may choose to use examples that enable only a limited number of strategies to be discussed
 the assessment may come in the form of comparisons in place elsewhere to manage human impact or on the basis of the extent to which they reduce the impact of different forms of human activity
 where the strategies are only described and there is minimal assessment the answer is unbalanced and unlikely to reach beyond the average category
 expect the effectiveness of strategies to be assessed in a detailed and balanced way for candidates to reach the very good category and examples to be well integrated in the answer
 indicative content expect candidates to examine the climatically stressed arctic alpine tundra environment with short and cool growing seasons
 latitudinal tundra occurs in the arctic and to a much lesser extent in the antarctic where the environments are characterised by cool short growing seasons
 however there are important environmental differences between these two tundras with the alpine type being subject to much larger variations of daily temperature during the growing season as well as more intense inputs of solar radiation during the day
 in contrast arctic tundra can experience continuous exposure to the rays with days for an extended period during the growing season
the interrelationships may be discussed in terms of the need for special adaptations required by biota to overcome climatic and soil constraints
 expect the range of climatic biotic and soil characteristics to be linked and discussed in a detailed and balanced way for candidates to reach the very good category and examples to be well integrated in the answer
 ltd landforms and their management glacial environments describe and assess the role of depositional processes in the development of one or more glacial landforms
 indicative content expect candidates to examine the production of one or more depositional landforms that are the result of predominantly glacial or fluvioglacial processes
 candidates who focus on a set of landforms that are essentially erosional can only reach the top of good as long as the reference to deposition as an influence on their development is central to the discussion
 expect the role of depositional processes to be assessed in a detailed and balanced way for candidates to reach the very good category and examples to be well integrated in the answer
 candidates could examine the production of landforms that may pass through a series of process changes from glacial to periglacial into present day conditions
 expect the landforms to be described and processes to be examined in a detailed and balanced way for candidates to reach the very good category and examples to be well integrated in the answer
 indicative content expect candidates to examine the production of one or more coastal landforms that are the result of depositional processes
 candidates who focus on a set of landforms that are essentially erosional can only reach the top of good as long as the reference to deposition as an influence on their development is central to the discussion
 expect the role of depositional processes to be assessed in a detailed and balanced way for candidates to reach the very good category and examples to be well integrated in the answer
 some candidates may structure the whole answer around two or more selected landforms but it is permissible for a broader approach to be taken with reference being made to a number of landforms by way of illustration
 indicative content expect candidates to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of global atmospheric circulation and its influence on the formation and location of global patterns of surface pressure and winds
 the tropics have an energy surplus as they gain more from insolation than is lost by radiation but the higher temperate and polar latitudes have an energy deficiency losing more by radiation than is gained by insolation
 this global transfer of energy is the basis of global atmospheric circulations which give rise to the low and high pressure belts and the planetary wind systems associated with the major convection cells the hadley ferrel and polar cells
 should show knowledge and understanding of a range of effects on human activity of better candidates may differentiate between the shortterm and effects of iii
 the hazards associated with systems in tropical regions include drought a falling water table loss of vegetation wild fires soil erosion and desertification
 the hazards associated with highpressure systems in temperate regions in summer are drought falling water tables and the loss of vegetation and winter hazards may include frost and fog with air pollution intensifying the fog conditions
 in tropical regions there may be reference to demographic effects at both time scales such as deaths and migration
 economic effects may analyse losses in the short term such as reduced crop and livestock production unemployment and increased food prices and costs in the long term such as reduced tax revenues
 social effects may include observations on health rationing increased fire hazards in summer and atmospheric pollution and difficult driving conditions in and disruption to schools
 there may also be consideration of the effects on the physical environment such as ground subsidence that impact human activity
 the emergence of south east asian nics and the countries russia india and may be used as a good illustration of the effect of economic change on changes in pattern
 all nations are open to outside influences of trade operations and these external relationships have strongly influenced the development process
 expect answers to provide a clear description of changes in development patterns together with sound explanatory comment to get into the very good category of assessment
 should show the ability to discuss the extent to which other factors such as third world debt social constraints and cultural barriers are responsible
 the surpluses are then sold below cost price on world markets countries outside the blocs find that the commodities being are the ones they have to sell and below the price that would give them any profit
 countries that were at a low level of development in the past were loaned money through the world bank and international monetary fund
 money that was generated firstly had to be spent on paying interest on the loan before repaying the debt and reinvestment in the economy was impossible
 the defines tncs as corporations that and control means of production or services outside the country in which they were their size is measured by revenues market capitalisation and sometimes employees
 location factors influencing the global shift include the availability of a large disciplined and skilled workforce suitable infrastructure political stability government incentives and a large domestic market
 at the heart of much of the rise of cultural globalisation has been the massive expansion of the entertainment and communications industry fuelled in particular by the spread of television
 the internet is central to this new development but also the spread of similar products often styled by tncs in a product and lifestyle and shared amongst people from many nations and cultural backgrounds
 the effects of cultural globalisation include the lack of local cultural diversity the loss of cultural identity and the development of a homogenised westernised consumer culture with greater cultural integration
 however the case for reduced cultural diversity is not a one some interesting and complex changes in the geography of consumption are taking place at regional and local scales such as the menus in india remaining entirely vegetarian
 expect answers to provide an examination of the causes and effects of cultural globalisation to get into into the very good category of assessment
 these offer reduced restrictions on land labour wages taxes and planning regulations to overseas firms especially those involved in industries
 the choice of shenzhen was especially strategic because it is situated near hong kong the key area from which to learn capitalist modes of economic growth
 the growth in economic activity in these locations has been reinforced by high levels of migration infrastructure improvements and the investment policies of tncs
 the result has been the emergence and dominance of economic activity in coastal areas which have received most internal investment as well as having imported capital technology and entrepreneurial skills at the expense of the interior
 expect very good answers to provide a clear description of spatial variations in economic growth and developed explanatory comment and to support their answers with specific illustrative detail including a sketch and examples
 should show some knowledge and understanding of the different ways in which economic growth in china is compromising sustainable ii
 indicative content expect candidates to mention that the relationship between the environment and economic growth is complex and poses something of a conundrum
 most human activity domestic and industrial produces waste which has to be disposed of and in turn affects air quality
 the optimistic view suggests that the range of demands on the environment can be managed in order to ensure a sustainable future
 there is a growing environmental awareness among grassroots organisations and communities in china but serious concern for environmental sustainability within the politburo is still overridden by the desire for economic growth
 despite that the government response to rio and kyoto suggested some recognition of the need for sustainability and the chinese signed the kyoto protocol in less than a year after it was set up
 environmental concerns are being taken seriously but bureaucratic problems and some corruption inhibit national policies being put into practice in local communities
 new premier li keqiang has vowed to tackle pollution and has pledged that his government will even greater but has failed to provide details
 candidates are most likely to argue that rural economy is still very important with some developments in agribusiness in some states due to technological developments and political reform
 the growth of service industries includes call centres back office jobs outsourcing from europe and an extensive financial and banking sector which supports the rapidly expanding indian economy
 reasons for the rapid expansion in the service sector include lower labour costs a large english speaking workforce a highly skilled and educated workforce and skills shortages in some developed countries
 technological factors have also played a significant role particularly the speed and distance over which communications and movement can now take place due to computer transport and communication technologies
 the growth in manufacturing is due largely to the growth in the urban middleclass educated population who have become consumers themselves providing a large market for new consumer goods
 expect very good answers to provide a detailed description of economic changes together with developed explanatory comment and specific illustrative detail and examples

 the optimistic view suggests that the range of demands on the environment can be managed in order to ensure a sustainable future
 environmental issues have been creeping up the political agenda in india but the challenges of addressing poverty as well as managing the environment sustainably are huge
 in the a ministry of environment and forests was created and now there are numerous autonomous agencies offices institutions set up by national and state governments
 there is a will to have environmental improvement but often this conflicts with other demands and in common with most other countries often puts government departments at odds with each other
 if candidates answer in a way that is not anticipated by the mark scheme but provide an acceptable answer to the question set please use the generic mark scheme to determine an appropriate mark
 written in a sound coherent essay style which is grammatically correct with a sequence of ideas that enable the question to be answered fully
 understanding of the route to enquiry and findings is present with some critical awareness but this may be sound rather than strong
 knowledge and understanding present but some points may be partial and lack exemplar support from research theme studied or may only be of potential relevance to the research topic
 expect there to be a range of methods of acquiring information both primary and secondary which may be illustrated or supported with examples e
 names of websites maps questionnaires environmental surveys and sampling where these relate specifically to the investigation credit should be given
 although an opinion cannot be marked incorrect credit is given for the justification of the position taken a balanced answer is best
 candidates can access this level without reference to their own investigation although if mentioned it should be given credit
 some understanding of the methods used to acquire information which may be either generic in nature or incomplete or unbalanced in coverage
 in their answers candidates should demonstrate their ability to communicate the strengths and weaknesses of the methods chosen and relate these to their findings ideally with some supporting evidence
 there may be some description of methods of analysis and presenting information which may be qualitative quantitative and illustrated with diagrams or examples
 examples described might include graphs line scatter pie photographs maps located symbols tables and field sketches rank mann whitney and standard deviation
 this means there are a number of possible candidates need to give the main ones and say which they tend to favour
 level level detailed outline of the findings of their investigation with good sound balanced assessment of the methods of analysis used and linked to the findings the range of the methods of analysis is appropriate
 these descriptors are written into the mark scheme for the examination and may be modified beyond these descriptors to accommodate the demands of individual questions
 if a candidate answers in an unanticipated way but it is clear that there is some substance to the answer the following guidelines may be used in allocating a mark to the answer
 answers need not be fully comprehensive but should be extensive enough to cover most aspects that can be reasonably expected for the question posed
 in answers at this level there will only be the beginnings of an answer to the question and will have major weaknesses
 correct information that could be relevant may be stated but it will be left to the reader to put two and two together
 any support that is given will be very general if a question has more than one aspect only one may be addressed and others ignored
 if only those early parts are attempted answers can gain a maximum mark of the top of level level range of evidence supporting more than one possible conclusion will be clearly stated
 this may be by showing that one piece of evidence carries more weight than others or that there are far more points in favour of one point of view than for any others
 these questions will often have a or what element and evidence given will be used to deal with such aspects
 there will be some attempt to show that there are arguments on both sides of the case but these will be few scattered and in most instances not supported by any evidence
 level answers at this level will be mainly simple description or basic explanation with evidence of some of the comparable qualities expected at level for the mark questions
 any attempt to deal with the evaluative components will be brief and either be very simple confined only to one side or have very little support
 for all questions the following qualifying words are accomplished competent intermediate basic beginnings these can be elaborated further a clear answer covering almost all aspects of the question with relatively minor if any faults
 the command is which means there should be description along with some explanation but the depth of explanation need not be exhaustive
 level either one factor only outlined well or more than one is presented but there is either a lack of clarity in description or any summary explanation attempted
 annotations for this ways described explanation of increase evidence candidates are likely to use information from figure on page and figure from pages and to help with their answers
 the resource folder gives some information but candidates will need to use their understanding of the topic to make the explanation clear
 level clear explanations of two or more ways in which food production may be increased are given with some degree of depth
 the resource folder goes a good way to providing support information but candidates will need a sound conceptual framework to provide good explanations
 either one reason is explained well with any other unclear or two or more reasons are suggested but are not complete
 one or more reasons may be given but the link to growth in areal extent is never clear or left for the reader to work out
 the range of evidence used the quality of discussion and the degree what is considered is the focus of the answer that will distinguish good answers here
 level answers at this level will make fully clear links between the growth in areal extent and food supplies with issues of sustainability introduced
 level good answer but with either imbalance between areal extent and food supplies or some lack of depth if both are considered equally or limited consideration of what of the truth of the statement
 frequent problems with structure and expression will be present level isolated points that could be relevant to the answer are made but are largely up to the reader to work out
 on this type of question some candidates launch straight into the evaluative part but incorporate the problems as they answer
 the second demand is of an evaluative nature and requires some appreciation of different points of view linked to sustainability and is more taxing
 level several problems associated with the supply of energy will be described in detail either separately or introduced throughout
 level several problems associated with the supply of energy will be will be suggested but some may lack detail or may be unclear or rather brief
 there may be some discussion of management and sustainability at the upper end of the range with one or the other neglected at the lower end

 all examiners are instructed that alternative correct answers and unexpected approaches in scripts must be given marks that fairly reflect the relevant knowledge and skills demonstrated
 many answers will not fall at the same level for each analysis refers to developed evaluation refers to the argued weighing of factors in relation to their significance in explaining an issue or in explaining linkages between different factors
 aos total mark for each question level level mark scheme recall select and deploy historical knowledge appropriately and communicate knowledge and understanding of history in a clear and effective manner
 clear and accurate understanding of most key concepts relevant to analysis and to the topic answer is mostly consistently and relevantly analytical with mostly developed and substantiated explanations clear understanding of the significance of issues in their historical context
 substantiated judgements about relative importance of links between factors will be made but quality of explanation in support may not be consistently high
 answer may be largely narratives of events and links between this and analytical comments will typically be weak or unexplained answers will mix passages of descriptive material with occasional explained analysis
 limited points made about or about developments in the context of the period will be little more than assertions and descriptions there is some relevant accurate historical knowledge this may be generalised and patchy
 no valid explanations typically very brief and very descriptive answer question mark scheme answer remained in power only because he silenced how far do you no specific answer is looked for
 candidates must deal adequately with the given factor even if they wish to argue that other factors were more important
 question mark scheme answer amongst his enemies were the main reason for military success in europe to how far do you no specific answer is looked for
 candidates must deal with the given factor adequately even if they wish to argue that other factors were more important
 in relation to the divisions amongst his enemies candidates may discuss some of the the divisions between political and military leadership at the weaknesses of coalitions and alliances and the tensions between britain austria russia and prussia
 rather than candidates may suggest it was the weaknesses in military machines that was the the size membership and organisation of their armies and their the competence of their generals
 candidates may well support their arguments by reference to italian campaigns the marengo campaign ulm and austerlitz jena and auerstadt and eylau and freidland
 question mark scheme answer consistent opposition of britain was the main cause of how far do you no specific answer is looked for
 candidates must deal with the given factor adequately even if they wish to argue that other factors were more important
 question mark scheme answer reign must be considered a how far do you candidates may assess success in relation to louis aims the results of policies the historical context
 question mark scheme answer how far were charles religious policies the main reason for the candidates will need to deal effectively with the given factor even if they wish to argue other factors were more important to score well
 they may link this to the anticlericalism associated with the revolution and the popular attack on the church in the press the fears of liberals at the growth of clerical influence and the link between clericalism and ultra influence
 question mark scheme answer to what extent was napoleon foreign policy a failure can be assessed against aims outcomes historical context
 assessments may take into account the context in which napoleon operated especially the suspicion of france and of ambition as well as the burgeoning power of prussia
 candidates may argue that whilst in the napoleon had some success in reviving french fortunes war and paris peace conference acquisition of nice and the international context meant any success was likely to be limited
 line of argument may well be that after some initial successes and arguably the achievement of nice and the general pattern was one of humiliation and failure resulting ultimately in the end of the empire
 question mark scheme answer assess the reasons why the compromise failed to resolve tensions between north and south in the candidates need to focus on the linkage between the compromise and the reasons it failed to resolve tensions
 candidates may discuss the nature of the and how it was passed discussing for example how far it was a real compromise and how far its specific measures were voted on separately rather than as a package
 in relation to confederate weakness candidates may economic weaknesses population industrial production transport leadership the slave problem and the failure to win british support
 candidates should balance such discussion against other factors the most obvious being the relative strengths of the industrial economic and manpower resources military capacity the political leadership of lincoln the generalship of grant sherman naval supremacy and strategy
 candidates may well argue that whilst the confederacy did have significant weaknesses and that these were to tell in the long run that they alone cannot provide a sufficient explanation of union victory
 they may well argue therefore that as long as northern morale held in the end their superior resources would tell especially given leadership and the determination of grant as a military commander
 question mark scheme answer how far were problems in the balkans the main reason for the first world candidates need to discuss the given factor effectively even if they wish to argue that other factors were more significant
 they may well link balkan issues to other causes through an examination of the development of the july crisis after that assassination
 in relation to military technology candidates may discuss the ways in which technology such as the machine gun rifles artillery barbed wire etc
 candidates may well argue however that other factors were more significant in bringing about war both in asia and europe
 question mark scheme answer assess the reasons why the provisional government was unable to survive in candidates must consider the role of a range of reasons and the linkages between them to score well
 they may also argue that it may have continued had it not been for the intervention of lenin the and the opportunism of the bolsheviks
 question mark scheme answer how successfully did lenin deal with the problems he faced in the period following the bolshevik revolution in to success may be assessed against aims results and historical context

 although the original rebellions were led by the lower orders the gentry were quite willing to encourage rebellion as openly as they dared and to direct the demands to their own ends
 they were seeking to give the king support against his more radical councillors and hoped to be supported by conservative noblemen like norfolk and shrewsbury
 the duke disbanded the royal yet it quickly became apparent that whilst the pilgrims had dispersed from doncaster the north remained prepared even enthusiastic for war if a settlement on their terms could not be achieved
 john mcgurk the tudor monarchies published the king made concessions promising to pardon all but ten of the ringleaders and to discuss their demands in parliament and to compromise on the restoration of the abbeys
 the historian neale however claimed that the reign saw these freedoms increasingly interpreted in the commons as constitutional rights rather than temporary privileges granted in the interest
 paul demand to be allowed to continue the debate on the succession despite the displeasure or the protests of his brother peter at royal management of the house were seen as crucial stages in the development of parliamentary independence
 graves elizabethan parliaments published elizabeth made royal government a conservative force resisting both the dangerous forces of further change and sensible moves to protect the state and the new church
 it should be emphasised that this was a problem for the lower house because bishops and nobles with their many lines of communication into the court had other ways of influencing the royal process
 the only practical solution for many knights and burgesses was to remove the existing restraints on free speech both formal and informal
 the commons on the other hand thought that their right of free speech allowed them to initiate bills on any subject they chose

 hence the supreme contradiction that cromwell the reluctant head of state the visionary was begged by his second parliament to become king
 contrary to what one might expect this was in order to limit his power to bind him with precedents and with the rule of law
 roger lockyer tudor and stuart britain published if cromwell hoped that by accepting the humble petition he would launch a period of harmonious relations between himself as lord protector and the representatives of the people he was quickly disillusioned
 as the political temperature rose a petition was circulated in the city calling for the abolition of the protectorate and the restoration of a sovereign parliament
 peter gaunt cromwell and his protectorate conflict and in ivan roots another published cromwell was able and willing to manage the parliament in his own way and to use his councillor mps and others to guide the house
 this was a belief perhaps born of an undue optimism that mps would share his goals and aspirations and that will would prevail

 investigations assessing quality of written communication will have a bearing if the is inconsistent with the communication element of the descriptor for the level in which the answer falls
 level descriptor marks uncritical and descriptive presentation of mainly random information about the topic investigated demonstrating a minimal ability to identify and select material relevant to the communicated within a largely simplistic and unstructured framework
 the writing will show elements of coherence but there are likely to be passages which lack clarity proper organisation
 the candidate will demonstrate some of the skills needed to produce a convincing essay but there may be passages which show deficiencies in organisation
 occasional syntactical spelling errors may be found but they will not impede coherent deployment of the material and argument
 level descriptor marks mainly descriptive response at a general level to the raised in the expression of a point of view that is logically consistent with the task supported by reference to a simple argument or unstructured imprecisely expressed
 an accurate statement of the main raised by the task with some attempt to set out reasons for alternative a point of view expressed clearly supported by some relevant evidence and argument and deploying some technical language appropriately
 the candidate will demonstrate most of the skills needed to produce effective extended writing but there will be lapses in organisation
 an attempt at an evaluation of the raised in the task typically through a careful analysis of alternative leading to a clearly expressed viewpoint supported by evidence and reasoned expressed accurately fluently and using a range of technical vocabulary
 thus most candidates whose religious understanding related to a given question suggests that they should sit in a particular level will express that understanding in ways which broadly conform to the communication descriptor appropriate to that level
 indicators of written communication are best considered normatively and may be used to help decide a specific mark to be awarded within a level
 quality of written communication which fails to conform to the descriptor for the level will depress the award of marks by a within the level

 it is likely that candidates may suggest that the power of the godwin family played a large role in causing many of the problems as edward was heavily dependent on them
 powers were limited and he needed to be able to implement whatever june marks guidance no set answer is looked for but candidates will need to answer the question
 saxon weakness could include military factors and this is a wide ranging term and might include issues such as tactics forces and weaponry available military leadership and the previous invasion by harald
 some answers might also consider religious factors and argue that it was only with papal blessing that william was able to gather a large enough force to be able to make the challenge
 in discussing castles candidates might consider their role as military and administrative bases their siting particularly on the south coast and borders or where there had been trouble
 in considering other factors candidates might mention that the death of harold at hastings deprived the of their major leader and it frequently meant that opposition was both divided and weak
 candidates may consider the policies that william followed such as castle building and how it was used or the of the which would have given a clear warning to those who might oppose his rule
 many of the risings were localised for example kent northumbria the south west and the welsh marches which made their suppression much easier
 in dealing with the problem in the north in with intervention from scotland and scandinavia william enjoyed clear military advantage which made his job easier as his forces were superior to anything the rebels could gather
 william was able to move swiftly to put down trouble before it had a chance to develop he acted decisively and used harsh methods which may have deterred others
 however his weakness should be balanced by a consideration of the problem of ambitious nobles such as warwick somerset and york
 it might be noted that the number of alienated nobility should not be most of the aristocracy continued to support henry suggesting an unwillingness to go to war
 it should be noted that the topic begins in and candidates are not expected to have specific knowledge of the reign of henry the minority etc
 question mark scheme answer reign was short lived because he was ineffective as how far do you june marks guidance no set answer is looked for but candidates will need to answer the question
 at the higher levels candidates will focus on they might disagree with the proposition and argue that richard was effective and point to issues such as his use of parliament
 however without previous events and developments he would not have alienated many who either supported henry tudor or waited to see the outcome
 the lancastrians always opposed him and henry tudor was the most dangerous therefore it might be argued that it was irrelevant whether he was ineffective as there would always be a challenge
 candidates might go on to consider some of strengths as they helped to remove these might include being a clever opponent and avoiding a direct confrontation with richard until he had a large enough force
 many answers are likely to consider the illegality of his seizure of the throne and argue that this was the start of his troubles as it raised doubts about his character and alienated some
 it will be relevant to discuss the probable murder of the princes in the tower but this must be linked to loss of support which culminated at bosworth
 candidates might consider his relations with the nobility including the execution of buckingham and could use this to argue that he was ineffective in his management of the nobility
 the distrust that surrounded richard was a key factor in explaining why he was unable to create a wide section of support
 his betrayal by stanley at bosworth might be interpreted either as justified or as the action of an unscrupulous noble who wanted to come out on the winning side
 some answers might also argue that promotion of northern nobles alienated a large number of southern nobles which would be crucial
 french ambitions in brittany and support for the yorkists as well as hopes of improved trade led to a spanish alliance in this treaty also secured a marriage between arthur and catherine
 candidates may explain why the divorce was so important and why henry would abandon his minister when he failed to deliver even though the circumstances were against him
 however some answers will consider longer term factors that weakened position making him more vulnerable when he failed to achieve the divorce
 in order to access the higher levels they must consider the feeling among the nobility who viewed him as a social upstart and resented his domination over henry and his attempts through the eltham ordinances to exclude them
 there might also be consideration of personal difficulties with henry shown in the building of ipswich school and the appointment to wilton abbey
 many may consider the changing relationship between church and state and argue that this was a major change which also impacted on the role of parliament
 there might be some discussion as to whether the privy council was reformed or if this had already happened under wolsey or was only under cromwell
 candidates should consider a range of reasons and weigh up their relative importance in order to access the higher levels
 candidates might consider issues such as a minor and a woman on the throne and how they were exploited by ambitious nobles such as somerset and northumberland
 in discussing issues of social and economic importance candidates might consider taxation enclosure the price rise and inflation but also the greed of landowners which contemporaries often blamed for the problems
 however some might balance this by suggesting that the failure of lady jane grey and the ease with which mary restored catholicism showed that northumberland had also failed
 question mark scheme answer how much opposition was there to the religious changes of mary tudor and cardinal june marks guidance no set answer is looked for but candidates will need to answer the question
 the restoration of catholicism to mary included the restoration of monasteries and not simply catholic she also wanted to the church so that it could fulfil its role
 with both the restoration of monasteries and finances most candidates are likely to argue that she failed and therefore argue that there was opposition particularly in parliament
 although mary was successful in achieving a catholic marriage and a very prestigious one to philip it cause unrest and there was no heir meaning that her protestant halfsister elizabeth succeeded
 the edwardian reformation had little time to make a large impact and task was therefore relatively easy shown by the length of time it took elizabeth particularly in the north to establish protestantism
 there are many examples that candidates might use to show the popularity of accession ranging from bonfires the ringing of bells to the singing of mass before it was law
 there was very little opposition in parliament to her changes and when there was opposition as over the exiles bill first fruit and tenths and heresy laws it was not for religious reasons
 some may balance this success against the marian burnings it could be argued that these had a negative impact although some might argue that the impact was negligible and that the negative impression is due to protestant propaganda
 candidates might consider how far they influenced the religious settlement and some might argue that they forced a more radical settlement on the queen
 the death of many leading puritans towards the end of the period might also suggest a decline in influence and this could be linked to the changing nature as it became associated with movements outside the established church
 the question of prophesying might be discussed particularly with reference to unwillingness to suppress them and as they were outside the control some might argue they were influential
 some answers might interpret faction too broadly and include puritans and therefore discuss their impact on the effectiveness of government
 at the top level candidates might point out that some factions cooperated against the cecil and leicester were not always rivals
 candidates might argue that parliament did try to discuss the issue but were largely unsuccessful in getting any answer from elizabeth
 some answers might argue that elizabeth handled the situation very well given the fact she was seen as illegitimate by some
 they may point to her handling of the issue of mary of queen of scots who was the potential heir but by not naming her it discouraged attempts to hasten her accession
 elizabeth was also masterful in exploiting her position as the and candidates might consider the various marriage proposals and how well they were handled and exploited by her
 there might be some consideration of the last years and the position of james how serious were the financial problems that elizabeth at the higher levels candidates should address the question of and not simply list the financial problems
 some might balance this against her inheritance and argue that because it was not much larger than the one she inherited and was considerably less than continental rulers the problem was not serious
 at the same time crown lands were sold reducing royal it may have reduced the seriousness in the short term but added to long term difficulties
 agricultural prices were rising at an alarming rate and added to harvest failures made the the worst decade of the century
 there were hopes of conciliation between the king orthodox anglicans and puritans at the hampton court conference suggesting that divisions and problems were not that great
 canons of resulted in the ejection of puritan clergy but it caused few serious problems although it might be argued that it created distrust
 this distrust was further developed by the choice of ministers particularly buckingham suggesting that he did not handle the divisions well
 candidates might discuss how well james handled the gunpowder it had the potential to be serious and although it was the work of a small minority did increase antipathy and hatred towards catholics
 the religious problems were exacerbated by the issues of foreign policy and marriage and candidates might discuss how well this was managed
 when james finally came to the aid of in the thirty years war in it was seen by most protestants as too late and unsuccessful
 james was also seen as being too close to catholic powers and this was given credence by the marriage negotiations with spain on behalf of his son charles
 some candidates may argue that james inherited a difficult financial situation revenue from taxation and assessment rates had not kept pace with inflation and the demands of war from last years of reign made the situation worse
 these considerations might be balanced against the cost of court and his attempts to revise customs duties through the book of rates which was unpopular
 belief in divine right did little to help the situation and made june marks guidance no set answer is looked for but candidates will need to answer the question
 question mark scheme answer parliament more reluctant to grant supply and use finance as a way to defend what they saw as just privileges to influence royal policy
 many candidates are likely to focus on the failure of the great contract in but they may apportion blame equally between james and the house of commons
 his munificence was never really controlled as james stated heart is greater than my this might also be linked to the level of rewards given to scottish favourites
 june marks guidance question mark scheme answer events of were the main reason for the outbreak of civil war in how far do you candidates may compare the importance of short term causes with longer term causes
 some might argue that it was actions in this period the five members and his decision to leave london which resulted in war
 when considering religion charles arminianism encouraged and enforced by laud was very different from the religion of many and created problems
 candidates might also consider other factors that cut across the periods and these might include political divisions including charles tendencies towards absolutism
 however it might be argued that it was the arrest and subsequent execution of strafford that was a turning point giving strength to the view that it was short term events that caused the war
 within parliament the momentum gave impetus to the war there were divisions between those who would be reconciled to the king and those who sought to weaken his position further

 however what ensued will go down in football a day of the highest possible drama that brought a fitting end to one of the most entertaining seasons in recent history
 it was manchester city who won the coveted their first league title in years a period in which their fans have suffered ridicule on a grand scale
 relegation to the third tier of english football saw them branded as a with even their own staff recognising their problems
 but all that was forgotten as they clinched the biggest prize in english football in the most dramatic of circumstances scoring two late goals to seal the trophy their fans players management and owners had long craved
 their victory had at one stage seemed enough to snatch the title from their rivals but late late salvo against changed it all within minutes scoring with their and shots of the match

 mark schemes are prepared by the principal examiner and considered together with the relevant questions by a panel of subject teachers
 this mark scheme includes any amendments made at the standardisation meeting attended by all examiners and is the scheme which was used by them in this examination
 the standardisation meeting ensures that the mark scheme covers the responses to questions and that every examiner understands and applies it in the same correct way
 as preparation for the standardisation meeting each examiner analyses a number of alternative answers not already covered by the mark scheme are discussed at the meeting and legislated for
 if after this meeting examiners encounter unusual answers which have not been discussed at the meeting they are required to refer these to the principal examiner
 it must be stressed that a mark scheme is a working document in many cases further developed and expanded on the basis of reactions to a particular paper
 assumptions about future mark schemes on the basis of one document should be whilst the guiding principles of assessment remain constant details will change depending on the content of a particular examination paper

 candidates might consider some of the buddhists are generally opposed to going to war as it violates the first precept and the principle of ahimsa
 many buddhists advocate a withdrawal from the world in order to evade tanha and gain enlightenment and so would avoid becoming involved in political disputes
 there may be circumstances under which some buddhists might be prepared to go to war if that would reduce the overall amount of suffering in the world possibly by righting a great injustice that causes great suffering
 many buddhists would say that war is an and is not compatible with the notion of right action or with the principle of compassion which underpins much of buddhist thinking
 buddhism does not generally prescribe action and has rather than rules so ultimately it is up to individuals to use their intellect and conscience to evaluate the different teachings and come to a conclusion about a particular war
 the importance of compassion or loving kindness in buddhist teaching may be discussed with some candidates suggesting that prisons are not places
 buddhist teachings are easily applicable to the idea of making a criminal face up to what they have done and take responsibility first precept requires buddhists to no and some might say that the prison system always causes harm
 having said this it could equally be argued that allowing criminals to continue in society also potentially causes harm
 the high rate of suggests that prisons do not rehabilitate prisoners well candidates may consider different types of prison security open prisons and the comparative benefits of these
 candidates might suggest that prisons are the best way for society to handle criminals even if individuals respond compassionately
 candidates might consider some of the christians are generally opposed to going to war as it creates suffering and goes against the teachings of jesus which are generally not always or pacifist
 quakers in particular are absolute pacifists as they believe that the suffering caused by war always outweighs any possible benefit or good that might result from the war
 nevertheless some christians believe that war can be acceptable under certain circumstances particularly if it satisfies the criteria of the just war theory
 it is therefore the responsibility of a christian to use their intellect and conscience to evaluate the different teachings and come to a conclusion about a particular war
 love compassion and forgiveness as central christian teachings and the belief that everyone has the potential to change may also be explored
 on the other hand some christians might point to the sanctions in the old testament which demand punishment for criminals and might point out that these make no mention of prison
 christianity would be likely to place particular emphasis on reformation and there may be discussion of the shortcomings of prisons in that regard
 candidates may suggest that there is no doubt that prisons protect the public in the short term but may point out that increasing crime rates suggest that they are not effective deterrents
 candidates may also discuss alternatives to prison and the extent to which they may be considered as more effective particularly at reformation
 candidates might consider some of the many hindus are opposed to going to war as it goes against the principle of ahimsa
 some candidates might also point out that war can sometimes be considered to be the lesser of two evils if it serves to reduce or eliminate great evil or suffering
 ultimately it is the responsibility of each hindu in accordance with varnashramadharma to use their conscience and intellect to evaluate the various teachings and come to a conclusion about each particular war
 the potential of each person as they contain brahman within themselves may be explored as may various stories from hindu scriptures about reformed criminals who became important holy men
 some may suggest that prison forms a natural part of the working out of karma or that prison is unnecessary as karma will deal with criminals without the need for human intervention
the duty of the king or state which includes upholding law and order and protecting the innocent and they may discuss prison as a possible way of achieving this
 hinduism would be likely to place particular emphasis on reformation and there may be discussion of the shortcomings of prisons in that regard
 candidates may suggest that there is no doubt that prisons protect the public in the short term but may point out that increasing crime rates suggest that they are not effective deterrents
 candidates may also discuss alternatives to prison and the extent to which they may be considered as more effective particularly at reformation
 candidates might consider some of the muslims are opposed to going to war under most circumstances as it causes suffering and injustice and spoils the world created by allah
 however islam does contain the concept of lesser jihad where under certain circumstances muslims are required by the to participate in warfare
 even under circumstances such as this there are strict guidelines about how such a war should be fought to limit the suffering caused by it and the time necessary to recover from it
 ultimately except in circumstances where the requires muslims to participate in a war it is the duty of muslims to work for peace if possible
 they must use their intellect and conscience to interpret the teachings of the and decide if it is appropriate to participate in a particular war
 candidates might consider some of the there may be some discussion of ways in which muslims have tried to improve prisons or the experience of prisoners as the work of prison or to provide alternatives to prison
 islam would be likely to place particular emphasis on reformation and there may be discussion of the shortcomings of prisons in that regard
 candidates may suggest that there is no doubt that prisons protect the public in the short term but may point out that increasing crime rates suggest that they are not effective deterrents
 candidates may also discuss alternatives to prison and the extent to which they may be considered as more effective particularly at reformation
 candidates may discuss the use of shariah law as an alternative to the prison system which is directly sanctioned by allah and is therefore preferable to the prison system which is human in origin
 candidates might consider some of the jews are opposed to going to war under most circumstances as it causes suffering and injustice and spoils the world created by is merciful and loving and would not want war
 the jewish scriptures look forward to a time when there will be no war and this is clearly seen as an ideal to aim towards
 however there are certain circumstances under which jews are required to take part in a war for example in self defence or to prevent an attack and for the obligatory wars of the jewish scriptures
 this may be felt particularly strongly since the shoah and many jews feel that any means would be justified in order to prevent a repeats of this
 even in circumstances where war is justified there are strict guidelines about how war should be conducted to limit the suffering caused by it and the time necessary to recover from it
 ultimately it is the responsibility of a jew to use their intellect and conscience to interpret the scriptures and decide whether it is appropriate for them to participate in a particular war
 candidates might consider some of the there may be some discussion of ways in which jews have tried to improve prisons or the experience of prisoners as the work of prison or to provide alternatives to prison
 some may point out that while the jewish scriptures contain several references to punishment no mention is made of a prison system and that this is not therefore the best way to punish criminals
 having said this the minor prophets in particular place emphasis on justice and some might argue that in the modern world the prison system whilst not perfect is the best way of achieving this
 judaism would be likely to place particular emphasis on reformation and there may be discussion of the shortcomings of prisons in that regard
 candidates may suggest that there is no doubt that prisons protect the public in the short term but may point out that increasing crime rates suggest that they are not effective deterrents
 candidates may also discuss alternatives to prison and the extent to which they may be considered as more effective particularly at reformation
 the example of jonah may be used to show how people may reform their behaviour over time and if treated appropriately
 candidates might consider some of the sikhs are opposed to war under most circumstances as it causes suffering and injustice and spoils the world created by waheguru
 certain groups within sikhism such as the namdharis are absolute pacifists and believe that war cannot be justified under any circumstances
 however there are certain circumstances in which sikhs particularly members of the khalsa believe that it is their duty to take part in a war to defend themselves or to defend those who are unable to defend themselves
 even under such circumstances there are strict guidelines about how a war should be conducted to limit the suffering it causes and the time necessary to recover from it
 the teachings of guru gobind singh make it clear that sikhs have a responsibility to take part in a war if it is necessary to defend the weak and vulnerable
 ultimately it is the responsibility of a sikh to use their conscience and intellect to interpret the teachings and decide whether it is appropriate to participate in a particular war
 the belief in waheguru as loving and merciful but also as upholding the rights of the innocent to be defended may be discussed along with the need to temper justice with mercy
 some may discuss the responsibility of the state to ensure justice and might suggest that while the prison system is not perfect it is the best way of achieving this
 sikhism would be likely to place particular emphasis on reformation and there may be discussion of the shortcomings of prisons in that regard
 candidates may suggest that there is no doubt that prisons protect the public in the short term but may point out that increasing crime rates suggest that they are not effective deterrents
 candidates may also discuss alternatives to prison and the extent to which they may be considered as more effective particularly at reformation
 credit must be given for examples of discrimination that are said or not for examples of prejudice or things that are responses might discriminating against someone unfairly because of colour race nationality ethnicity mark for response
 candidates might consider some of the buddhists believe that the external differences between people are essentially maya and unreal so there is no reason to treat people differently
 it makes no sense to differentiate based on race or gender since these things are ultimately illusions which have no absolute reality
 it is therefore necessary to abandon these behaviours which are based on ignorance in order to follow the noble eightfold path and make spiritual progress
 candidates might consider the idea that in order to treat people with equality it is not always necessary to treat them in exactly the same way
 for example men and women may have different roles in society but that does not mean they are not of equal worth
 they may suggest that people should have the right to choose a religion and some may make reference to the declaration of human rights
 some candidates may mention the role of religious studies in allowing young people to evaluate different faiths and choose a spiritual path that suits them even if this is made up from ideas from a variety of faiths
 credit must be given for examples of discrimination that are said or not for examples of prejudice or things that are responses might discriminating against someone unfairly because of colour race nationality ethnicity mark for response
 candidates might consider some of the christians believe that all people were created by god and so inequality makes no sense
 christians have often engaged in missionary work which seeks to bring justice and equality as well as to spread the message of god
 missionaries might say that as all are the creation f one god all equally have the right to hear the gospel and have the opportunity for salvation
 some might say that christianity has a duty to influence politics to bring about equality either by peaceful protest or through liberation theology
 for example men and women may have different roles in society but that does not mean they are not of equal worth
 some have even continued to hold a christian faith but have included ideas or symbols from other traditions in a way that makes christianity more meaningful to them and so allows them to continue to be christian
 however in gospel jesus appears to make claims about the exclusivity of christianity as a way to reach god and salvation
 many christians believe that being a christian is a of salvation and so would seek both to convert others and to prevent christians from moving away from the faith
 they may suggest that people should have the right to choose a religion and some may make reference to the declaration of human rights
 credit must be given for examples of discrimination that are said or not for examples of prejudice or things that are responses might discriminating against someone unfairly because of colour race nationality ethnicity mark for response
 candidates might consider some of the hindus believe that the external differences between people are essentially maya and unreal so there is no reason to treat people differently
 it makes no sense to differentiate based on race or gender since these things are ultimately illusions which have no absolute reality
 failure to follow dharma correctly will lead to bad karma which makes it difficult to achieve moksha or to gain a favourable rebirth
 since brahman is in all there is no reason not to treat all people equally since all beings are ultimately the same being
 candidates might consider the idea that in order to treat people with equality it is not always necessary to treat them in exactly the same way
 for example men and women may have different roles in society but that does not mean they are not of equal worth
 likewise varnashramadharma means that all people have different roles but for many hindus all are ultimately a part of brahman and will be seen as such once ignorance is overcome and so they are of equal worth
 candidates might consider some of the hinduism is generally a pluralist religion meaning that hindus believe all religions are valid paths to the divine
 having said this there are branches of hinduism that believe they offer an exclusive path to salvation and would seek to convert others
 they might suggest that they have a unique perspective that would be useful to everyone so that changing religion could give a deeper insight into the divine and give someone the opportunity to seek moksha
 the bhakti traditions in particular might feel that salvation is only possible through love and devotion to a particular god
 they may suggest that people should have the right to choose a religion and some may make reference to the declaration of human rights
 credit must be given for examples of discrimination that are said or not for examples of prejudice or things that are responses might discriminating against someone unfairly because of colour race nationality ethnicity mark for response
 equality within the ummah is a key concept within islam and this is emphasised in the symbolism of hajj where all wear the same clothing regardless of personal wealth or status
 muslims have a responsibility to treat all members of the ummah as family and should not therefore discriminate on grounds of wealth gender or ethnicity
 since all people were created by allah and according to islam all are born muslims candidates might suggest that all people have an equal right to hear about islam and have the opportunity to revert
 social justice is a key feature of islam demanded by the as part of a righteous islamic society and equality is essential for social justice
 candidates might consider the idea that in order to treat people with equality it is not always necessary to treat them in exactly the same way
 for example men and women may have different roles in society but that does not mean they are not of equal worth
 living in a muslim state are protected and treated with fairness and respect and to this extent muslims would agree with the statement
 on a technicality most muslims would agree with the statement as they believe all are born with a natural inclination towards allah and so islam is the religion they are born into
 muslims may particularly seek to dissuade those they see as following a polytheistic religion as this would be regarded as shirk and would be severely judged by allah
 they may suggest that people should have the right to choose a religion and some may make reference to the declaration of human rights
 candidates might consider some of the jews believe that all people were created by and so inequality makes no sense
 the minor prophets in particular place great emphasis on justice and mercy and justice is a key feature of the messianic age
 some might say that the shoah gives jews and example of what happens when inequality is allowed to flourish and that they would therefore go to great lengths to prevent it
 candidates might consider the idea that in order to treat people with equality it is not always necessary to treat them in exactly the same way
 for example men and women may have different roles in society but that does not mean they are not of equal worth
 most jews see themselves as a chosen people who have been given the responsibility to set an example to the nations and to obey all of the commandments
 however membership of the jewish faith is not seen as the only way to please and all who keep the noahide code are acceptable
 it is not generally necessary or even desirable for to change their religion as long as they worship only one and live an ethical life in accordance with the principles of the jewish scriptures
 jews may also seek to dissuade people who follow a religion they see as polytheistic as this breaks the noahide code
 they would also seek to dissuade jews from rejecting judaism as this weakens the jewish people and could also be seen as a direct rejection of and disobedience towards as well as a violation of the covenant agreement
 to this extent they could be seen to disagree with the statement candidates may point out that many people are not born into any religion and are raised as broadly agnostic
 they may suggest that people should have the right to choose a religion and some may make reference to the declaration of human rights
 credit must be given for examples of discrimination that are said or not for examples of prejudice or things that are responses might discriminating against someone unfairly because of colour race nationality ethnicity mark for response
 candidates might consider some of the sikhs believe that all people were created by waheguru and that since waheguru transcends race and gender inequality is pointless
 khalsa sikhs in particular believe that they have a duty to uphold justice and safeguarding equality is part of this
 khalsa sikhs are obliged to defend the rights of the weak and vulnerable by force if necessary and so equality is a key value for them
 sikhism has consciously rejected the varnashramadharma system of hinduism and acknowledges all people of whatever gender race or religion as equal
 sikhs must agree to eat a communal meal with any who worship with them as a symbol of this and all people of any faith are welcome in the gurdwara
 candidates might consider the idea that in order to treat people with equality it is not always necessary to treat them in exactly the same way
 for example men and women may have different roles in society but that does not mean they are not of equal worth
 furthermore the guru granth sahib contains the writings of hindus and muslims as well as sikhs and there is no idea that mukti is available to sikhs alone

 many biblical teachings condemn casual sexuality which is often shown as normal in the media and this is likely to lead to unhelpful attitudes towards sex
 much of the sexual content in the media may also lead to the objectification or sexualisation of women which goes against the key teachings of judaism
 candidates might argue that not all sexual content in the media is bad as much of it is educational or promotes a healthy view of sex and so is helpful
 others might suggest that removing all sexual content from the media is not a practicable or achievable target and so would be a waste of time and resources
 some might suggest that no one minority group should have the right to something effectively dictating to the conscience of others
 june mark guidance responses may focus on different uses of generic media and do not necessarily need to be tied to specific forms of media
 candidates might consider some of the candidates might concentrate on a central character such as any of the gurus on important figures in contemporary sikhism
 they may consider whether they have shown the religion in a good or bad light and the extent to which this might encourage offend or upset sikhs
 they might consider whether sikhs might seek to censor such productions or to act as consultants to make sure that the impression achieved is one with which they are comfortable
 some candidates might suggest that sikhs might be encouraged or inspired particularly by the stories of the gurus to stand up for social justice and the rights of the weak and vulnerable as they have done
 on the other hand they may be angered or discouraged by accusations of immorality or corruption and might even be temped to abandon their faith
 many sikh teachings condemn casual sexuality which is often shown as normal in the media and this is likely to lead to unhelpful attitudes towards sex
 sikhism encourages modest dress for both men and women and may feel that the lack of this in the media encourages the objectification and sexualisation of women in particular which goes against the key teachings of sikhism
 candidates might argue that not all sexual content in the media is bad as much of it is educational or promotes a healthy view of sex and so is helpful

 annotate in the margin as level poor knowledge and understanding of an appropriate issue using little or no evidence from the resource
 the context is clearly a and so comments taking this into account are likely to indicate top of level responses
 planning hazard mapping slope stabilisation techniques such as regarding drainage planting vegetation where both long and short term responses included likely to indicate top of level response
 indicative content possible geographical issues the threats posed by human activities to any components in the physical environment that the environment might back in the future unintended consequences e
 how protected should environments can the use of environments be comments about these issues in terms of both intended and unintended ways a possible indicator

 mark scheme question answer june marks the focus of this option is on inequalities their patterns causes and implications for communities and the environment
 contrasts in the quality of life of peoples in different parts of the europe stands out followed by the considerable variation amongst asian countries including indian africa is clearly in most need of development
 mark scheme question answer june marks assess the extent to which flood risk results from human rather than physical factors
 systems approach might serve a response well here as it will structure the answer to consider a variety of factors and how change in one factor can bring about feedback elsewhere in the drainage basin coastal system systems
 guidance knowledge and understanding level substantial knowledge and authoritative understanding of both physical and human factors involved in risks from flooding causes and effects are convincing
 some responses might be assessed at this level if they offer a particularly uneven account of either physical or human
 there is effective evaluation of the relative significance of the factors both physical and human with a balanced coverage of the two sets
 some evaluation of the relative significance of the factors both physical and human although likely not to be balanced between the two sets
 communication is generally effective although errors in grammar and spelling and some inaccurate use of geographical terms are likely to be present
 indicative content the spec asks that some specific earth hazard events and locations susceptible to earth hazards are investigated so we can expect some effective exemplification
 responses might consider points such as the scale of the hazard including the energy urban rural degree of predictability and the ability to predict in the context of economic development
 guidance knowledge and understanding level substantial knowledge and authoritative understanding of the impacts of earth hazards in the context of a variety of levels of economic development
 level sound knowledge and understanding of the impacts of earth hazards in the context of at least two contrasting levels of economic development
 analysis interpretation and evaluation economic development tends to go hand in hand with technological development which can have a significant influence on the impact of earth hazards
 it is very important that we recognise the broad scope of this question and so a level response does not need to include reference to every type of earth hazard
 what will be limiting is if the answer includes only one level of development and does not consider the wide range of levels in the world
 some evaluation of the relative significance of the links and vulnerability and preparedness are discussed although likely not to be balanced between the two
 communication is generally effective although errors in grammar and spelling and some inaccurate use of geographical terms are likely to be present
 one of the key ideas in this option is activity poses threats to physical environments in both planned and unintended the key evaluation is therefore between the relative impacts of planned and unintended
 indicative content as knowledge and understanding of the components and interactions of physical environments has developed so anticipated consequences are possible
 deforestation is often quoted in this context such as tropical rainforests for example the clearance of indonesian forests for palm oil plantations
 episodes such as the dust bowl of the of the in the earlier part of the century and the introduction of alien species both deliberate and accidental are relevant and well documented
 communication is generally effective although errors in grammar and spelling and some inaccurate use of geographical terms are likely to be present
 indicative content candidates should be secure in their knowledge and understanding of physical components to be awarded top of and in components such as climate geology and soils flora and fauna should considered and their role evaluated
 there is at one level of the discussion a strong case to be made for the proposition such as reference to the great biomes of the world e
 similar case might also be made for local ecosystems where for example local relief in the form of aspect can have a profound influence
 some responses might be assessed at this level if they offer a particularly uneven account of either physical or human components
 communication is generally effective although errors in grammar and spelling and some inaccurate use of geographical terms are likely to be present
 tropical storms for example have a major impact on the coastal zones they first enter but if they then track inland their intensity soon diminishes as they loose contact with their source of energy
 for example bangladesh can be severely affected by coastal flooding following a storm surge whereas many caribbean countries receive greater impacts from river flooding and slope failures as a consequence of a tropical storm
 comments about bangladesh for example can take a response to the top of in but the explicit contrast with other locations is likely to indicate a answer
 some responses might be assessed at this level if they offer a limited interpretation of physical geography such as simply the strength severity of the climatic hazard
 analysis interpretation and evaluation it could be argued that heavy snowfall has more severe impacts in areas of steep relief than locations with gentle slopes
 heatwaves are perhaps more severe in inland locations than by the coast where there is usually a degree of amelioration due to land and sea breezes
 candidates can also offer comments about the relative significance of where a location is along the development continuum as being more significant than physical geography
 much of the coastal zone of the gulf coast and the eastern seaboard of the is but only occasionally does a level clear and convincing analysis of the impacts of climatic hazards
 question mark scheme answer tropical storm have a major impact such as hurricane sandy in october small scale locations can also advance a discussion here
 the influence of aspect can be significant in terms of localised snowfall for example june marks guidance level limited analysis of the impacts of climatic hazards
 communication is generally effective although errors in grammar and spelling and some inaccurate use of geographical terms are likely to be present
 storm tracks change quickly in particular landfall and so the impact of a tropical storm as regards the strongest winds and highest storm surge are not exact
 the impact of high rainfall as regards flooding and mass movements is likely to be generally known but not the details
 depressions and anticyclones are well monitored but timings and strengths are not exact remember rainfall varies considerably along a front for example
 convectional thunderstorms are notoriously difficult to predict in terms of guidance knowledge and understanding level substantial knowledge and authoritative understanding of the predictability of climatic hazards
 some responses might be assessed at this level if they offer a particularly uneven account of climatic hazards such as much detail about tropical storms but less about anticyclones
 responses focused on only one climatic hazard such as tropical storms are likely to be assessed at this level
 effective evaluation could come from analysing precipitation patterns as a front impacts on low and high altitude locations for example
 communication is generally effective although errors in grammar and spelling and some inaccurate use of geographical terms are likely to be present
 one of the key ideas in this option is that the demand for and supply of resources need to be planned and managed to achieve a sustainable candidates should therefore have thought about and researched the management of resources
 level in is likely to be indicated by a response picking up on is becoming indicative content there is the immediate and simple association between increasing population numbers and resource demand
 the higher level responses are likely to appreciate the wide variety of resource types which is likely to allow their discussions to be more convincing and authoritative
 the basic physical nature of resources should be evident and examples given of where physical factors are have been significant in management strategies
 comments about what consists of are welcome with discussion of how contested a term this is likely to indicate a response in aos most will simply rely on the brundtland definition
 there are physical challenges for some resources such as soils and forests when population pressure is significant in some regions
 but evaluation comes in the form of the opportunities albeit many are small scale such as or the use of stone walls along contour lines
 for example the change in demand for foods such as meat in some regions of the world where is rising and the impact this has on the supply of cereal
 contrasts between and amongst countries at different points along the development continuum are welcome and are likely to indicate level june marks guidance skills and communication level clear structure and organisation including a clear conclusion
 communication is generally effective although errors in grammar and spelling and some inaccurate use of geographical terms are likely to be present
 candidates will have studied both population dynamics and various issues concerning resources which can be brought together in a discussion here
 indicative content classically overpopulation is identified as excess of population in an area in relation to resources or to other broader economic or social goals
 certainly there are some helpful and tragic historical examples as well as more contemporary case studies which would help an analysis
 underpopulation is a situation where an increase in population of an area would improve the ratio allowing that population to raise its living standards through the use of resources
 for example one approach might be to suggest that as pressure builds up through overpopulation then assertion that necessity is the mother of invention comes into play
 some responses might be assessed at this level if they offer a particularly uneven account of either or underpopulation
 question mark scheme answer the nature of the types of challenges such as environmental economic or social is worthy of discussion and candidates doing this are likely to be writing at level and above
 responses focused simply on sparse dense populations are unlikely to reach beyond the bottom of level in both and june marks guidance skills and communication level clear structure and organisation including a clear conclusion
 communication is generally effective although errors in grammar and spelling and some inaccurate use of geographical terms are likely to be present
 one of the key ideas is that brings advantages and disadvantages to various and that impacts may be environmental economic social or this question asks for an evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of social impacts
 indicative content the definition of social must be a broad one and we can accept a wide range of material here
 the most convincing responses in aos might be indicated by the acknowledgement that globalisation is a contested concept and so there are different perspectives to be considered
 the question is deliberately a broad one and advantages disadvantages can be seen as they impact on countries right across the development continuum
 the creation of internationally recognised brands of goods and services encourages people especially in the developing world to aspire to lifestyles that differ from their local culture
 however the flow of social elements is not one way for example the diffusion of cuisine and music to medcs from areas in africa asia and latin america
 language is a key element of the social impacts for example the level clear and convincing analysis of the social impacts globalisation can have
 this also can be evaluated for example the impacts of tourists in locations or labour migration in various parts of the world
 communication is generally effective although errors in grammar and spelling and some inaccurate use of geographical terms are likely to be present
 it will be possible to access marks from the very detailed analysis of a single country or by a broader consideration of more than one country
 the recent growth in services such as finance and insurance as well as tourism tends to benefit medcs more than other groups of countries
 guidance knowledge and understanding level substantial knowledge and authoritative understanding of the structure and direction of a trade and the impacts of globalisation there is secure use of detailed exemplification
 it can be that the narrow range of commodities especially in agricultural products fuels and mineral ores leads to difficulties
 communication is generally effective although errors in grammar and spelling and some inaccurate use of geographical terms are likely to be present
 the upward spiral of growth due to the exploitation of initial advantages the creation of employment and development of external economies of scale result in many advantages for a core
 traditionally some of this growth is seen as being at the expense of the periphery as backwash effects draw in resources commodities and to the core
 the friedmann model is explicitly mentioned in the specification and is relevant here highlighting as it does the changing relationship between core and periphery
 these manifest themselves in factors such as high cost of land and housing crowded infrastructure above average wages high levels of pollution
 possible level indicator is the inequalities that can be generated within a core as seen in the differential advantages one guidance knowledge and understanding level substantial knowledge and authoritative understanding of core areas and their role in development
 communication is generally effective although errors in grammar and spelling and some inaccurate use of geographical terms are likely to be present
 poverty means that the choice of where to live is limited and poor housing is linked to poor health absence from work and low incomes
 linkages can be seen in developing countries where the general absence of jobs in the formal sector often results in many people being or many having casual employment
 guidance knowledge and understanding level substantial knowledge and authoritative understanding of the role economic factors can play in generating inequalities within either a named region or large city
 level sound knowledge and understanding of the role economic factors can play in generating inequalities within either a named region or large city
 level poor knowledge and understanding of the role economic factors can play in generating inequalities within either a named region or large city
 question mark scheme answer assessment of will be determined by the quality of evaluation of the interlinking of economic with social political and environmental factors
 communication is generally effective although errors in grammar and spelling and some inaccurate use of geographical terms are likely to be present

 this mark scheme includes any amendments made at the standardisation events which all examiners participate in and is the scheme which was used by them in this examination
 the standardisation process ensures that the mark scheme covers the responses to questions and that every examiner understands and applies it in the same correct way
 as preparation for standardisation each examiner analyses a number of alternative answers not already covered by the mark scheme are discussed and legislated for
 if after the standardisation process examiners encounter unusual answers which have not been raised they are required to refer these to the principal examiner
 it must be stressed that a mark scheme is a working document in many cases further developed and expanded on the basis of reactions to a particular paper
 assumptions about future mark schemes on the basis of one document should be whilst the guiding principles of assessment remain constant details will change depending on the content of a particular examination paper
 verbal answers in english the basic principle of assessment is that candidates should gain credit for what they know understand and can do
 however these aspects are an integral part of assessing communication and marks cannot be awarded where errors in spelling punctuation or grammar lead to a failure to communicate the required information without ambiguity
 where a candidate has given alternatives or additional information in answer the following criteria should be if the does not contradict the key idea or make it ambiguous if the contradicts the key idea or makes it ambiguous reject
 where numbered lines are given within a of a question credit should be given for correct answers no matter which line they appear on
 where a question has more than one section a candidate may include as part of the answer to one section the information required to answer another section
 in questions where candidates are asked to name for example three types of vegetable sold in the market only the first three items they write down should be considered
 if the rubric instructs them to write one letter or number in the box and they do so but write a second letter or number outside the box too then the answer in the box should be considered
 tout court where a candidate has crossed out an answer and what was underneath remains legible then it should be assessed
 where a candidate spells the answer in such a way that it is a word in the target language no credit can be awarded
 if a candidate offers two different responses in english or in the target language eg dog or dog where the answer is dog no credit can be awarded

 my view is that the men who were shot in cold blood were prisoners of war and therefore it was entirely incorrect to slaughter them
 however a certain number of these executions was absolutely necessary to teach the traitors who take german money that they cannot cover dublin with blood and ashes without forfeiting their lives
 a letter sent by healy to his brother may healy was an irish nationalist the action in ireland of the military has aroused bitterness
 all the commandants of the rising except one had then been shot under decrees of intervention however saved many lives and felt grateful to him for putting an end to the bloodshed
 for use with question paul adelman and robert pearce great britain and the irish question published parnell was associated with the land league and at the height of his power was regarded as the embodiment of irish nationalism

 margarita barns india today and tomorrow published barns was an english journalist who established a foreign news agency in the hindus were convinced that the muslims were receiving help from the british government on the divide and rule principle
 while no one could deny that there were grounds for this belief it was largely a rationalisation of their own uncompromising attitude
 mr gandhi lost the biggest opportunity of his life when he did not take his courage into his hands and in open defiance of the hindu leaders take responsibility for a settlement with the muslims
 the spokesmen of both communities rejected him so it was difficult for him to sustain his claim that he represented per cent of india
 the man responsible general dyer was mildly censured by the army and strongly defended by his superiors the house of lords much of the press most conservative mps and a large number of ordinary people
 dane kennedy britain and empire published the indian army grew from to by the end of the first world the total number of indians to serve in uniform during the conflict came close to one and a half million
 though it remained a volunteer army to the end there is little doubt that the scale of the wartime mobilisation strained indian society and strengthened the indian nationalist movement

 tim leadbeater britain and india published in jinnah sensed that the tide was finally turning in favour of the muslim league with him in control
 the fact that jinnah did not clarify this publicly until six years later has raised questions about his true objectives
 he was clearly a secular muslim and he did not truly regard a state based on a religious definition as a wise solution
 it follows that he was like many a politician arguing tactically for far more than he really thought possible or desirable in order to achieve more than a realistic demand would
 their greatest mistake occurred in june when they rejected the cabinet proposals for a federal solution to communal problem after jinnah and the muslim league had reluctantly accepted it

 list of regulations drawn up by the rhinelander flemish and english crusaders sailing from dartmouth on may included decrees against extravagant dress and on the confinement of women to the living quarters and on weekly confessions and communion
 the idea of fighting the remission of was probably unprecedented in the early it would never have been easy to justify the inflicting of pain and loss of life on others
 the crusaders moved by their love of god renouncing wives children and earthly possessions and adopting temporary poverty and chastity were described as going into a voluntary exile
 it was for this reason that participation in the first crusade was considered to be in some sense an alternative to entry into the religious life
 preparations for crusades were always marked by acts of penitence as when in king louis of france spent a few hours before his departure among lepers in a leper house
 has this approach any disadvantages or different interpretations of in early modern europe read the following extract about and then answer the questions that follow
 so when first encountered this material was drawn to using psychoanalytic theory because it seemed to offer the best way of explaining the deeply disturbing themes of such confessions
 often accusations of witchcraft were made by young mothers against the old women who were closest to them the maids who cared intimately for mother and child
 but psychoanalysis is less useful once one tries to deal with a whole society and comprehend why fears about witches were so widespread in the towns and villages of and germany
 the problem faced was how to build the detail of subjectivity and the sheer power of unconscious forces as they emerge in the confessions into a history that would be about a whole society and not just about individuals
 menopausal and women were disproportionately represented amongst the victims of the witch craze and their is the more striking when we recall how rare women over fifty must have been in the population as a whole
 in the cases of witches from the wurzburg trials we know the ages of only of those who were executed and around a quarter of those were men
 they were people who might be thought likely to envy young mothers in the prime of life and so wish to harm fertility
 many of the images of pregnant women also display old women their shrivelled bodies an ironic commentary on the transience of the fertile full figure
 while both sexes were regarded as suffering from the ravages of age social status was tied more closely to their reproductive capacity
 her entire household did not want her to live there because another witness said are many children and pregnant people believed that gron attacked their fertility
 so widespread was the assumption that witches were old women that even women who confessed to the crime of witchcraft frequently mentioned seeing old women at diabolic gatherings

 explain how this approach has contributed to our understanding of has this approach any disadvantages or turn over different american wests read the following extract about the american west and then answer the questions that follow
 many a frontier was above all a frontier of prospective cities as they were envisioned by optimistic speculators who were not restrained by a strict regard for the truth
 most settlers uttered vigorous condemnation of speculators but they were only thinking of wealthy easterners who did not expect to live in the regions where they were investing
 each westerner was himself a land speculator and he could hardly have been expected to forego the most obvious opportunity for profits
 certainly farmers wanted cheap land but they took surprisingly little advantage of the free land provided under the homestead act of within recent years scholars have been investigating the acquisition of new land
 most of the land was acquired by means other than the homestead act and many who did use it were only interested in selling out to later arrivals or to lumber companies or grazing companies
 the great movements of population to the west took place in times of prosperity rather than in periods of depression and relatively few of the migrants came from the more industrialised parts of the east
 the concept of an unemployed and penniless mill worker moving to take up a job or a farm in the west is difficult to imagine
 his basic choice was not that of individual freedom but of an occupation in which he expected to increase his personal fortune most rapidly hence he chose a farm in illinois rather than a mill job in lawrence massachusetts
 the frontier desire was not a log cabin in the wilderness but a comfortable home in a settled community that could provide markets stores banks schools roads and theatres
 the frontiersman was even anxious to obtain governmental aid in such matters as banking and the building of canals and railroads
 true enough the westerner made some unpleasant innovations such as the sod house and was forced to develop some new techniques but he accepted in general the virtues and ideals which he had been taught as a youth
 feeling that each new frontiersman shed his old customs started anew and became a real american appears to have been more a hope than a fact
 its distinctive characteristics must be the product of men of particular abilities and backgrounds operating in a certain geographic setting
 no nation living on the edge of a wilderness for most of its national existence could fail to be affected by that experience

 according to the earliest reports of speeches the code words he used for jews outnumbered the plain usurers profiteers big capitalists communists foreigners
 the key passage in the first document is a letter from it rational must lead to a systematic opposition and elimination of the special privileges that jews hold
 in retrospect it seems likely that hitler had settled on his radical already back in november as he claims in mein kampf
 but once he encountered alfred rosenberg political horizons he began to see the jews primarily as an international group whose destruction demanded an international policy
 thus fitting piece by piece into a larger scheme hitler combined the annihilation of the jews with the destruction of bolshevism both of which could be accomplished by an invasion of russia

 examiners should also be prepared to award zero marks if the response is not worthy of credit according to the mark scheme
 where some judgement is required mark schemes will provide the principles by which marks will be awarded and exemplification may be limited
 when examiners are in doubt regarding the application of the mark scheme to a response the team leader must be consulted
 history marking guidance marking of levels of response the mark scheme provides an indication of the sorts of answer that might be found at different levels
 it is intended as a guide and it will be necessary therefore for examiners to use their professional judgement in deciding both at which level a question has been answered and how effectively points have been sustained
 candidates should always be rewarded according to the quality of thought expressed in their answer and not solely according to the amount of knowledge conveyed
 however candidates with only a superficial knowledge will be unable to develop or sustain points sufficiently to move to higher levels
 at the end of each answer examiners should look back on the answer as a whole in the light of these general criteria in order to ensure that the total mark reflects their overall impression of the worth
 deciding on the mark point within a level the first stage is to decide the overall level and then whether the work represents high mid or low performance within the level
 one stronger passage at level would not by itself merit a level award but it would be evidence to support a high level award unless there were also substantial weaknesses in other areas
 assessing quality of written communication qowc will have a bearing if the qowc is inconsistent with the communication descriptor for the level in which the answer falls
 if for example a history response displays mid level criteria but fits the level qowc descriptors it will require a move down within the level
 these will be supported by limited factual material which has some accuracy and relevance although not directed at the focus of the question
 they will however include material which is either descriptive and thus only implicitly relevant to the focus or which strays from that focus
 candidates offer an analytical response which relates well to the focus of the question and which shows some understanding of the key issues contained in it
 the candidate will demonstrate the skills needed to produce convincing extended writing but there may be passages which lack clarity or coherence
 candidates offer an analytical response which directly addresses the focus of the question and which demonstrates explicit understanding of the key issues contained in it
 mid level marks as per descriptor high level marks the qualities of level are securely material is convincing in range and depth consistent with level the exposition will be controlled and the deployment logical
 thus most candidates whose historical understanding related to a given question suggests that they should sit in a particular level will express that understanding in ways which broadly conform to the communication descriptor appropriate to that level
 indicators of written communication are best considered normatively and may be used to help decide a specific mark to be awarded within a level
 quality of written communication which fails to conform to the descriptor for the level will depress the award of marks by a within the level
 responses may refer to his position as king of piedmont in appointing cavour encouraging the war of accepting the states of naples and sicily at teano in and his subsequent role as the king of italy
 these answers may establish that he was more than a by contrasting his role with the more direct contributions of individuals such as cavour and garibaldi or by reference to foreign influence
 these answers will establish arguments in a broadly balanced response while the best may attempt to evaluate extent or integrate the arguments into an overall judgement
 level answers will attempt analysis with some understanding of the focus of the question probably by either agreeing or disagreeing with the suggestion
 however the supporting material is likely to be descriptive or lacking in depth and relevance in places and there may be some inaccuracies
 level answers will offer some relevant simple statements about the question asked supported by limited though broadly accurate material in places
 number indicative content mark the question is focused on the process of italian unification in the years and requires an analysis of and judgement on the extent to which france was responsible for the pattern of unification
 responses may refer to french dominance in the events leading to and during the war of and the subsequent agreement at villafranca which led to the loss of nice and savoy and continued austrian presence in venetia
 it may also be suggested that french was directly related to decision to launch his expedition to sicily the annexation of venetia in and the eventual of rome
 some candidates may suggest that other factors were responsible such as the growing power of piedmont or the role of austria or that the of the french was only one of many factors which shaped italian unification
 these answers will establish arguments in a broadly balanced response while the best may attempt to evaluate or integrate the factors into an overall judgement
 level answers will attempt analysis with some understanding of the focus of the question probably by explaining the role of france in italian unification
 however the supporting material is likely to be descriptive or lacking in depth and relevance in places and there may be some inaccuracies
 level answers will offer some relevant simple statements about the question asked supported by limited though broadly accurate material in places
 this significance however may be balanced with reference to the emergence of more significant influences such as the role of bismarck or by the equally influence of economic factors
 other candidates may suggest that the outcomes of the revolutions had relatively little influence as the revolutionaries were comprehensively crushed prussia proved too weak to take advantage of events and austria reestablished its dominant position at olmutz
 this lack of influence might be highlighted for example by the suggestion that economic factors were of greater influence or that it was not until after that the forces which would lead to eventual unification began to emerge
 these answers will establish arguments in a broadly balanced response while the best may attempt to evaluate extent or integrate the arguments into an overall judgement

 number indicative content mark the question is focused on the process of german unification in the years and requires an analysis of and judgement on the suggestion that it was driven by diplomacy

 responses might also suggest that the main core of fascist supporters were those italians directly threatened by the rise of socialism such as the rural and urban middle and middle classes along with nationalists landowners and industrialists
 with the liberal state increasingly unable to respond to socialist threats to law and order many italians turned to the fascist squadristi to maintain order instead
 level answers will clearly address by considering the fear of socialism in relation to other factors and will support the analysis with a range of accurate factual material in some depth across most of the time period
 these answers will conflicting arguments in a broadly balanced response while the best may attempt to evaluate or integrate the factors into an overall judgement

 candidates may refer to conservative opposition as single factor identify different elements of conservatism such as the army church monarchists landowners etc
 in reference to the impact of conservative opposition on the government of the republic in years candidates might suggest that after the successful introduction of a range of reforms conservative opposition undermined the republic in a number of ways
 some candidates might suggest that weak government was due to the between factors showing that the rapid reforms of led to fierce conservative opposition which undermined the initial successes leading to mistakes and highlighted internal divisions
 level answers will clearly address extent by considering the role of conservative opposition in relation to other factors and will support the analysis with a range of accurate factual material in some depth across most of the time period

 responses might suggest that actions had a considerable impact on the partition of germany with reference to the policies of president truman once the division of germany agreed at the yalta conference was ratified at the war potsdam conference
 the extent to which actions were responsible for these events however might be challenged by reference to the greater importance of other factors or the of variety of factors
 answers might suggest that soviet provocation was of much greater importance or that a chain reaction of cold war events resulting from the collapse of germany in led inevitably to partition

 number indicative content the question is focused on the political and economic relationship between east and west germany in the years and requires an analysis of and judgement on the extent to which these relationships changed over time
 the question covers a period of forty years and it is expected that candidates will select a range of key within the chronology with which to illustrate change over detailed discussion of events cannot be expected
 from the political and economic relationship between east and west germany was essentially one of separation but there were changes in the relationship over time
 during the east germany took advantage of détente to establish greater economic links in the basic treaty and this continued despite the less conducive political climate in the when west germany loaned the east almost billion deutschmarks

 in the radical islamist activity increased with for example the development of alqaida and other groups direct action against perceived enemies including arab states international bombing campaigns and the resurgence of radical palestinian politics
 the question is focused on events in the middle east and gulf regions and so specific references to attacks outside of the region cannot be expected
 however candidates may refer to attacks such as that on the world trade centre in as an example of wider aims and consequences
 islamist aims to be independent of foreign intervention to bring islamic ideals to the governance of arab states and to support a separate palestinian state were therefore all undermined

 candidates can refer to events to highlight the extent to which germany was prepared for war and should be accordingly rewarded
 the specification suggests that candidates will mainly refer to the extent to which the german economy the military and society were prepared for war
 foreign policy is not explicitly referred to in the specification and so it cannot be expected that candidates will refer specifically to foreign policy to reach the higher levels of the mark scheme
 much of the nazi social and economic policy in the was directed towards the ability of germany to fight a war in europe
 the four year plan introduced by goering from was designed to prepare germany for war military conscription was responsible for much of the decrease in unemployment and nazi youth policy was directed towards encouraging militaristic ideas particularly for boys

 there is a link between self esteem and individuals with low self esteem are more likely to blame themselves for failure
 dweck argues that children attribute their failure in the competitive situation to things that they have no control over such as lack of ability or luck
 they demonstrated a tendency to concede defeat and opt out of sports after initial failures because there was no visible prospect of improvement
 individuals suffering from learned helplessness avoid challenges as they believe that they can do nothing to alter the course of events
 obese and other unhealthy people could be monitored to heck whether they are taking exercise and have their benefits cut if they fail to do so under proposals published by westminster council

 high level sports performers rely on extensive scientific and technological support in order to succeed at the very highest levels
 introduction technology in sport relates to ergogenic aids that are designed to enhance an performance both in training and during competition
 sport is reflection of society and so advances in the scientific and technological world will inevitably manifest themselves within the avenue of sport
 is it naïve to assume that sport can exist in a some might question whether such technological advances are ethical concept of a level playing field
 technology is often linked with making sport more exciting for spectators cricket bats capable of hitting more sixes or rackets enabling players to fit faster serves

 the majority of performers will be near the bottom of the pyramid whilst the higher you more up the pyramid along the performers become more skilled and commitments levels to sport increase
 there is inevitably a link between the different levels of the pyramid and so changes at one end as in the funding of elite will have a knock on effect at the other
 sport spends more than million per annum its elite performance programmes through a combination of exchequer and national lottery funds
 is this approach too baroness sue campbell chair of sport notes the importance of investing money strategically to make the greatest impact
 in times of economic austerity every penny must count and must be directed towards producing results the nation would expect
 there are a number of benefits that are associated with success in international sporting competitions as world cups and olympic and many governments now feel that it is a legitimate use of public funds to support elite athletes
 however supporting elite sport is very costly and others argue that funds could be better used in other areas such as health education and the promotion of sport for all
 may of the sports that have lost funding are team yet these are the sports where participation rates at grass level are likely to be highest
 should all sports be mass spectators sport such as football golf and tennis can surely thrive without an injection of government money

 this is to be used in both questions where is a factual error irrelevant material and in an inaccurate questionable or unconvincing grouping of the sources for the question
 demonstrate understanding of the past through explanation analysis and arriving at substantiated judgements key concepts such as causation consequence continuity change and significance within an historical the relationships between key features and characteristics of the periods studied
 source evaluation is reasonably full and appropriate but lacks completeness on the issues raised by the sources in the light of the question
 source evaluation is partial and it is likely that the provenance itself is not compared may be undeveloped or merely commented on discretely
 identifies some comparative points but is very sequential and perhaps implicit comment on the sources is basic general undeveloped or juxtaposed often through poorly understood quotation
 analyse and evaluate in relation to the historical context how aspects of the past have been interpreted and represented in different ways
 convincing analysis and argument with developed explanation leading to careful supported and persuasive judgement arising from a consideration of both content and provenance
 level level mark scheme and b good attempt at focused analysis argument and explanation leading to a supported judgement that is based on the use of most of the content and provenance
 june and b grouped analysis and use of most of the sources with good levels of discrimination and a reasonable focus on the interpretation
 is aware of some of the limitations of the sources individually or as a group but mostly uses them for reference and to illustrate an argument rather than analysing and evaluating them as evidence
 level level level mark scheme june and b attempts some analysis argument and explanation but underdeveloped and not always linked to the question
 mark scheme june the origins and course of the french revolution question answer marks guidance the context is the attempt of the reforming minister turgot to increase revenue by comparison increasing prosperity as the physiocrats urged
 turgot was a believer in free trade and wanted to end of two sources restrictive practices and traditional barriers to progress
 the trade guilds were a considerable vested no set answer is interest and an obstacle to individual enterprise and the free development of market forces
 for it is of workers and long the headings and for the apprentices need to be in their and have their domestic life attributions should supervised
 on the reference to both is other hand thinks that tyranny is more likely to come from the police regulations necessary to control expected in a good apprentices if the authority of the guilds is removed
 a reforming minister desiring free trade and reform in economic life generally is expressing a justification for a reform of an established but restrictive institution in a published law
 a body made up of vested interests and defending traditional authority is expressing a protest in the context of dislike of ministerial induced changes which seem likely to increase royal power
 might be seen as useful for the desire for change the influence of the enlightenment or physiocratic sentiment among the educated bourgeoisie and an indication that reform might have been possible had turgot not fallen foul of vested interests
 might also be seen as more useful for question mark scheme answer showing the difficulties of reform that ministers faced and the passionate adherence to tradition even at the cost of economic prosperity and freedom
 royal ministers all give an impression of necessary reforms a desire to serve the king and to tackle the key weaknesses of late century france impaired economic progress and weak royal finance
 however it could be countered that they served the king well by bringing problems to the attention of the nation by offering considered solutions
 the most radical changes were perhaps those proposed by calonne in by this time attempts to solve the financial problems by raising production and promoting economic free trade and development had failed
 the opening of accounts and the financial management offered by necker secure loans at lower interest had not ended the deficit and was seen as a sleight of hand
 the proposal for a general land tax which would include the king and the church as well as the nobles was a radical idea
 something of the same confidence can be seen in in which june marks guidance judgement in context based on a set of sources and own knowledge
 successful answers will need to make use of all five sources testing them against contextual evidence and evaluating their strengths and weaknesses any limitations as evidence
 the rather angry tone of is another sign of in enlightened ideas that did not survive the poor support of the king or the vested interests which opposed it
 the counter view is in and although candidates could also use elements of and and none of the schemes in and were allowed to run their course
 it could be argued that the strategies represented here were flawed and the tone arguments and types of reform mentioned could be used to argue that case
 none of the ministers could gain the necessary political support but it mean that their solutions were not viable and that in trying they were serving the monarchy well
 in terms of provenance is written at the start of the reign when a reformer like turgot might have expected new measures supported by a new king who was far from reactionary
 the tone is impassioned and reflects the impatience of the intellectual administrator towards any barrier to what he thinks is intellectually justified
 either this shows that turgot did not consider their sensibilities or it shows that he was on the right lines in engaging with fundamental resistance to change
 by the american war had made financial matters a lot worse hence the need for public confidence in government finance to ensure that vital loans were not dependent on very high interest rates
 the confidence of the preface therefore is deliberate but in any case also reflects this it could be argued that the policy was facile and the compte was not accurate
 it could also be argued that by it was vital with a rising deficit to restore confidence and introduce transparency
 like and is also trying to persuade and by the financial situation is even more desperate so a more fundamental reform is proposed
 the reforms are all worthy but the means of delivering them may be questioned and also by now the chances of major reforms had been diminished
 however the revolutionary context had led to a mood of popular discontent and the criticism of the ministers in this source may be thought to be unfair
 according to risked his own and the comparison approach of danger his presence of mind and courage were which is confirmed in of two sources
 which says that there is any real danger he goes to the spot at once and cannot be held no set answer is both agree that he placed great store by his men and his openness towards them
 in he is expected but described as a chief of a and in is utterly simple in and always candidates need to prepared to meet compare the contents evaluating such there are differences
 he is described as on horseback aid evaluation and giving orders and visiting as well as the landscape for however reference to both is places store by his charisma and personal appeal
 his voice and strong is regarded expected in a good as and he is revered as and it is implied that his sincerity was respected answer
 talking out of real in terms of provenance whatever the differences between the two sources candidates are likely to recognise that both authors are favourably inclined to garibaldi
 indeed the way in which refers to deficiencies judged against the qualities of regular generals is more an implicit criticism of the latter than of garibaldi
 nonetheless some might interpret the comment that set off without knowing where they might as evidence that is mindful of faults
 dandolo in was one of soldiers with actual experience of life in army and who had no doubt received orders from him and had time to make an assessment of his leadership
 on the other hand when was writing garibaldi had conquered sicily and question mark scheme june answer marks naples and was feted as a victor and highly successful commander who had prevailed against the odds
 the of the south was already being seen as one of the great moments of th century history and it was writers like monnier who contributed to this in such passages
 the sources provide a mix of approaches to garibaldi a soldier a foreign writer king victor emmanuel a popular cartoon and garibaldi himself
 all sources provide evidence of the support and admiration enjoyed by garibaldi though and indicate that this was not universal
 in we are told set off without knowing where they might and garibaldi was chief of a which suggests he enjoyed the loyalty of his men
 this source provides a and balanced sketch of garibaldi as a commander and may be considered by candidates as sound evidence particularly when measured against the opponent in the french army
 candidates might comment on the fact that his men were whose commitment was not in doubt many of whom had fought with garibaldi in earlier campaigns
 details about the red shirts and the huge reputation garibaldi and his men had by could usefully be deployed to assess the source in terms of the relationship between garibaldi and his men
 successful answers will need to make use of all five sources testing them against contextual knowledge and evaluating their strengths and weaknesses any limitations as evidence
 question mark scheme answer marks name he has a halo above his head and his bust sits on the altar
 however some are likely to challenge the value of simply on the grounds that cartoons tend to be in their view point and that such is being implicitly criticised
 nonetheless ever since his exploits in rome in garibaldi had been portrayed in prints and pictures as a saint some likening him to christ
 in contrast elements of suggest it is objective although itself is from a foreign observer whose intellectual stance suggests a form of heroworship
 further context might be deployed to explain how the majority of people in naples were glad to see the demise of the authoritarian regime in naples confirmed in a subsequent plebiscite
 throughout his procession from sicily garibaldi had allowed the redistribution of land to varying degrees and local officials had had their authority checked as garibaldi assumed the powers of a dictator however temporary
 indicates the hostility of the king who is vitriolic in condemning garibaldi saying he destroy and that he rejected the proposal he be allowed to march on rome
 june guidance question mark scheme answer marks candidates will know that both men opposed any change to the independence of the papacy napoleon for domestic political reasons and pius to retain his temporal power
 knowledge of the hostility to italian nationalism since the allocution of would be appropriate and the actions of napoleon in restoring and upholding the pope in power since could be considered
 the alliance of rattazzi to these two men indicates how politicians and piedmont were opposed to garibaldi whom they regarded as a threat to their own power and a dangerous demagogue whose radical ideas threatened the new regime
 life liberty and the pursuit of denied by slavery and in brown is blunt in claiming no set answer is design on my part to free the both oppose slavery as a religious calling
 in the author expected but says thank god that he enabled me to speak his and in the author invokes the teaching candidates need to of the new testament as a reason for opposing slavery
 in garrison emphasises his commitment to and and in brown contents evaluating stresses his ultimate aim is achieve both are motivated by a strong sense of personal such matters as conviction that explains their opposition to slavery
 brown was on trial for attributions should his life and making what he almost certainly knew would be his last statement against slavery
 garrison reference to both is was writing much earlier in the first edition of a magazine that he assumed would continue to expected in a good promote the abolitionist cause
 by contrast brown writing almost years later had experienced years of protest and setbacks in the cause of abolition and his comments strike a more realistic note about the difficulty of achieving success
 in making a judgement some candidates may argue that both sources indicate the commitment even fanaticism of abolitionists and provide a fair summary of the main political and religious mark scheme june question answer reasons for opposition to slavery
 the reliability of the sources might be challenged however given the propaganda circumstances of both relevant contextual knowledge is considerable and can usefully be deployed to support the assessment of the sources
 marks guidance all the sources can be used as evidence for the interpretation that abolitionist activity undermined their cause though only is unequivocal
 counter argument that their activities advanced the cause can be constructed using parts of and and judgement in context based on the set of sources and own knowledge
 successful answers will need to make use of all five sources testing them against contextual knowledge and evaluating their strengths and weaknesses any limitations as evidence
 in abolition societies are condemned for having nothing good or webster credits them with arousing strong but accuses them of hardening opinion in the slave states and of making things worse
 candidates might argue that as a contribution to these debates source is flawed as the author was looking for ways to persuade the south to reach an agreement and he thus deliberately criticises the abolitionists
 further this speech concentrates on opinion in the south only and whilst it may accurately reflect attitudes there it does not make any comment on views in the north
 candidates may argue it was unlikely that abolitionist activity would win much support in georgia where slavery was so widely accepted
 knowledge that it was on december that south carolina seceded from the union might be mentioned to illustrate that the views in were shared in other places
 the trial of brown and his expectation that he would be executed expressed in might be used to confirm the hostility of the south to the abolitionists
 further claims that the abolitionists were a fanatical although calhoun does so from a southern perspective implying that they represented a minority
 the case for a successful promoting of their cause is also evident in candidates might cross reference with on some issues
 after all a similar moral position is adopted in but the action advocated in that source is one of persuasion with the pen rather than violence and personal sacrifice
 in forming a judgement candidates may argue that the sources are useful in providing views from both sides of the debate
 some are particularly reliable such as and as they admit to the strength of the abolitionists even though they despise them suggesting that they undermine their cause
 june guidance mark scheme the sources are similar in that both show that germans in the view of federal republic ministers are behaving selfishly and are creating economic problems
 source says that small family groups or even single people are clinging on to large flats where the rents are controlled and thus cheap
 source confirms this impression implying that germans are only interested in earning high wages and working shorter hours whatever the cost to wider society
 they will price themselves out of a job in comparison to their competition where wage increases are running at a much lower percentage
 both ministers want to take corrective state action lucke in by loosening the controls on rents adenauer in through wage and price controls
 source finds the fault to be over regulation by the state in housing whilst finds fault with the german people and especially the german trade union movement
 source hints that efforts to force higher productivity will not work with the german people and especially the trade union movement
 it also sees the problems in an international context and is worried that west germany will lose its competitive edge
 the dates of the sources can be used to assess them and by the latter there were fears of the economy becoming uncompetitive
 it resulted from the policies of the government to encourage family life and to draw a distinction between life in west and east germany
 his tone is that of puzzlement and concern especially as he was in line for the succession to adenauer
 question mark scheme answer the sources contain references to different interpretations so they may be grouped according to their view
 source the report from bosch supports this success with details of how the demand for bosch products has grown and they are even exporting their goods
 it indicates that consumer durables goods and were now available for domestic consumption although a company report may well put an over positive gloss on its achievements for the sake of the shareholders
 source the article about pension reform supports the view that there was success in improving a generous pension scheme with no means testing and where the pension is to become a legal right
 the amount of the pension is to be enough to ensure a good living standard for all workers and testifies to the success of west germany under adenauer
 the opposing view is clearest in source which shows that some of the largest accommodation is being hogged by small families to the detriment of those bringing up more children
 question mark scheme answer knowledge may comment on the large influx of refugees from the east willing to work at lower rates of pay and who needed housing
 this may lie behind plan to open up the renting market although it could be pointed out that it will also help landlords at the expense of existing tenants
 source warns that there will increasingly be losers whose lives will be far from improved if the rush to high wages continues
 source is likely to be reliable as companies must comply with legal requirements in making reports and the facts could be easily checked
 the other sources are all by ministers in the government who will thus want to defend their actions or propose new measures to remedy perceived problems
 the victory for the governing party in three successive elections suggests that something was going well for the christian democrats two of whom appear reasonably confident of success
 the need to prevent germany lapsing into extremism on the right or the left also played a part but as the later sources suggest by the later there was less stability and even a possibility of economic stagnation
 they may also make a distinction between economic success and and social the latter proving more problematic in sources and success may thus be qualified to a greater or lesser extent
 no specific judgement is expected guidance question mark scheme june answer marks guidance the contents and provenance of the sources have some similarities
 they are dated from the same a day six weeks after chinese penetration of north korea and just three days after troops comparison of suffered a major reverse and retreated before the advancing chinese troops
 both the authors are central to war policy macarthur as no set answer is of forces in the far east and marshall also a general as the secretary of expected but defense
 however one has a military capacity on the spot and the other a senior political role in candidates need to washington
 source suggests that the chinese so using the intervention in korea was the result of its own strategy planned after the landing at inchon
 sources in contrast marshall in source sees chinese intervention as evidence of carefully laid russian evidence for which might be explained as a design to lure the americans into invading china or using chinese the headings and nationalist forces
 russian purposes might be inferred as to divert attention away from soviet attributions should influence in korea and involve the in a major war with china
 evaluate the credibility of claim that the directed events lessening the reliability of no set conclusion is source they also differ on how to react to chinese intervention
 he is an advocate of using this to launch substantiated an invasion of china to reverse the communist triumph in in contrast marshall in strongly judgement should opposes this and is aware of the wider cold war context
 be reached for the top levels of the it might be supplied from knowledge and provenance that macarthur in source unlike marshall in mark scheme
 in evaluation it might be suggested that these differences might be explained by purpose to justify his forward policy of communism against previous containment policy under truman
 nonetheless his telegram is largely confined to a factual account of chinese intervention speculative only in the final two sentences
 therefore source an internal top secret address to the national security may be more informed and useful as to official views
 the introduction to source confirms this although it might be supplied from knowledge that macarthur in source disobeyed orders and was sacked in april so his attitude might put his evidence especially his final views in question
 nonetheless events largely confirmed his fears of a further spring offensive although the possible destruction of forces in korea is speculative
 based on the set of sources and sources and to an extent and suggest that the was to blame while own knowledge and in part sources and might be used to suggest that the was to blame
 successful answers will need to sources and in part and support the interpretation in the question that china make use of all five sources was to blame
 this is a of issues may be addressed in telegram which seeks to persuade the joint chiefs to take action against china
 source is similar to both in its military authorship and in its fears of chinese aggression but goes on to comment on asia as a whole
 however source here is less useful as evidence for this interpretation as it suggests that china does not wish to prolong the war but to sign a peace so it can advance its wider ambitions in asia
 question mark scheme answer marks sources and in part are useful in support of an alternative interpretation that the was to blame for prolonging the korean war
 marshall states unequivocally that the was dictating chinese aggression in korea and knowledge of the treaty signed between stalin and mao in moscow on january might be used to develop this
 however it may be evaluated as unreliable in the light of independent nationalist policies and for the interpretation in the question in source which states that china acted on its own behalf in prolonging the war
 nonetheless marshall is a key element in the formulation of policy and would have been supplied with the latest intelligence reports
 source by suggesting that the was moving towards peace and that the chinese also wanted peace indirectly implies that it could only be the who was holding up a treaty
 it might also be argued that the wished china to intervene openly to distract forces while the secretly aided north korea
 thus source reliability might be brought into question due to hindsight authorship and context although it fits what is known about the war
 knowledge might be used to confirm that russia refused to agree that communist prisoners held by the americans could choose whether to june guidance question mark scheme answer marks return to north korea or china
 his purpose seems to be to persuade the public that a peace treaty will endanger interests elsewhere in asia by allowing chinese strength to build up
 sources and in part and might be used for a third argument that the was mainly to blame for prolonging the korean war
 source truman and ewing are discussing the pow issue and whether to refuse to return those communist prisoners who sought western asylum a difficult one given the fear of admitting communist agents into the west
 source might be used with the introduction to to argue that advance beyond the parallel prolonged the war which might otherwise have ended when troops reached the parallel
 source confirms that crossing the parallel was a political decision by the and to address north korean aggression but knowledge might qualify the content by suggesting that forces held back the from total war
 however he typifies right wing opinion and speaks out in favour of total war from a position of supposed superiority although he does admit the american people wanted peace
 the sources supporting this view are likely to be seen to imply rather than argue the case for blaming the however it is up to candidates to assess and decide upon relative importance here there being no set conclusion

 lack of growth in some parts of the euro area arose from both imbalances in trade and capital flows that built up after the adoption of the common currency
 further this lack of growth resulted from weaknesses caused by poor competitiveness particularly in the labour market reinforced by higher price increases and higher labour costs in euro area countries since the beginning of the monetary union
 problems in the labour market were caused by restrictions in hiring and firing workers high minimum wages and centralised wage bargaining
 research shows that product market reforms such as reducing barriers to competition and improving the business environment can lift growth substantially
 labour market reforms in addition to raising growth and employment in the long term can restore lost competitiveness by giving employers more flexibility in hiring and firing workers and keeping wage growth under control
 however such reforms are unlikely to deliver a sufficient boost to activity during the current economic slump when aggregate demand is weak

 examiners should also be prepared to award zero marks if the response is not worthy of credit according to the mark scheme
 where some judgement is required mark schemes will provide the principles by which marks will be awarded and exemplification may be limited
 when examiners are in doubt regarding the application of the mark scheme to a response the team leader must be consulted
 history marking guidance marking of levels of response the mark scheme provides an indication of the sorts of answer that might be found at different levels
 it is intended as a guide and it will be necessary therefore for examiners to use their professional judgement in deciding both at which level a question has been answered and how effectively points have been sustained
 candidates should always be rewarded according to the quality of thought expressed in their answer and not solely according to the amount of knowledge conveyed
 however candidates with only a superficial knowledge will be unable to develop or sustain points sufficiently to move to higher levels
 at the end of each answer examiners should look back on the answer as a whole in the light of these general criteria in order to ensure that the total mark reflects their overall impression of the worth
 deciding on the mark point within a level the first stage is to decide the overall level and then whether the work represents high mid or low performance within the level
 one stronger passage at level would not by itself merit a level award but it would be evidence to support a high level award unless there were also substantial weaknesses in other areas
 assessing quality of written communication qowc will have a bearing if the qowc is inconsistent with the communication descriptor for the level in which the answer falls
 if for example a history response displays mid level criteria but fits the level qowc descriptors it will require a move down within the level

 assessing quality of written communication will have a bearing if the is inconsistent with the communication element of the descriptor for the level in which the answer falls

 level descriptor mainly descriptive response at a general level to the raised in the leading to a point of view that is logically consistent with the task supported by reference to a simple argument or unstructured imprecisely expressed
 an attempt at an evaluation of the raised in the task typically through a careful analysis of alternative leading to a clearly expressed viewpoint supported by evidence and reasoned expressed accurately fluently and using a range of technical vocabulary
 thus most candidates whose religious understanding related to a given question suggests that they should sit in a particular level will express that understanding in ways which broadly conform to the communication descriptor appropriate to that level
 indicators of written communication are best considered normatively and may be used to help decide a specific mark to be awarded within a level
 quality of written communication which fails to conform to the descriptor for the level will depress the award of marks by a within the level

 assessment objectives and candidates may draw on their knowledge of interactions involving younger children including their own siblings or on research own or that of into the language of young children
 basic answers are likely to demonstrate a grasp of how the dynamics of interaction here create meaning noting that for the most part the mother and leonie speculate about romana frequently referring to her and occasionally addressing her directly
 candidates may mention as skinner or of without fully understanding these or linking them to specific details in the transcription
 stronger answers are likely to refer to details in some of the utterances as aspects of noting for example her frequent pauses and regular questions
 they may also explore the process of acquisition making use of the phonemic information offered and expanding their discussion to take in other instances of difficulty such as consonant clusters
 basic answers may make general assertions about how parentchild interactions typically involve an intention on the part of the adult to encourage the language development but may focus more on the of this conversation than on its linguistic content
 how do the speakers use language here to interact with each other and share their support your answer by referring to specific examples from the transcription
 even so clearly not easy for the individuals here to talk about themselves and candidates may notice that it take lines of reference to third parties before sarah mentions what ive been doing
 they may try to incorporate prepared material on child language acquisition which fit the transcription evidence or argue that instances of are indicative of limited linguistic development
 stronger answers will make more helpful use of theories of language development recognising that theorists such as giles will be more useful here than piaget vygotsky chomsky and skinner
 they are likely to explore aspects of such as the use of like to introduce quotation and as a and they may see the proliferation of this feature as an aspect of convergence
 it would be equally valid to see the in terms of prestige or sociolect or but approaches which make assumptions about social class levels of education are not likely to be helpful
 more productive approach would be to concentrate on how aspects of shared knowledge and understanding emerge from the linguistic and interactional features
 stronger answers are likely to explore specific examples of idiolect sociolect and to discuss ways in which shared language can reflect shared attitudes and experiences
 for example lexical choice of totally terrified is understood as comic exaggeration and the reference to the concert in the park last year which depends on shared causes no problems of comprehension
 stronger answers will start from the transcript evidence rather than making assumptions about what one might from a group of young people

 this mark scheme includes any amendments made at the standardisation meeting attended by all examiners and is the scheme which was used by them in this examination
 the standardisation meeting ensures that the mark scheme covers the responses to questions and that every examiner understands and applies it in the same correct way
 as preparation for the standardisation meeting each examiner analyses a number of alternative answers not already covered by the mark scheme are discussed at the meeting and legislated for
 if after this meeting examiners encounter unusual answers which have not been discussed at the meeting they are required to refer these to the principal examiner
 it must be stressed that a mark scheme is a working document in many cases further developed and expanded on the basis of reactions to a particular paper
 assumptions about future mark schemes on the basis of one document should be whilst the guiding principles of assessment remain constant details will change depending on the content of a particular examination paper
 the extra information is aligned to the appropriate answer in the part of the mark scheme and should only be applied to that item in the mark scheme

 at level candidates are required to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding and their ability to sustain a critical line of argument in greater depth and over a wider range of content than at level
 select and demonstrate clearly relevant knowledge and understanding through the use of evidence examples and correct language and terminology appropriate to the course of study
 in order to ensure the marking scheme can be and consistently and to examiners to mark in a standardised it defines levels of response by which answers are assessed
 this ensures that comparable standards are applied across the various units as well as within the team of examiners marking a particular unit
 in candidates answer a single question but are reminded by a rubric of the need to address both objectives in their answers
 in the marking scheme each question is provided with a brief outline of the likely content lines of argument of a answer but this is by no means prescriptive or exhaustive
 examiners must not attempt to reward answers according to the extent to which they match the structure of the outline or mention the points it contains
 the specification is designed to allow teachers to approach the content of modules in a variety of ways from any of a number of perspectives and answers must be assessed in the light of this flexibility of approach
 it is quite possible for an excellent and valid answer to contain knowledge and arguments which do not appear in the each answer must be assessed on its own merits according to the levels of response
 synoptic skills and the ability to make these are now assessed at as specification due to the removal of the connections papers
 question mark scheme indicative content candidates might begin with the contemporary situation of amos in eighth century samaria during the prosperous reign of jeroboam over israel
 responses might use analysis of the book and some exposition of the text to illustrate the condemnation of the people for false religion and social injustice which amos feels called to make
 candidates may select their texts to address the question from the very beginning or they may draw the points together in a conclusion as to the extent amos deserves the doleful title
 to support the statement candidates might argue that the concluding passages which lighten the book of amos may be subject to literary uncertainty about their origin and purpose
 another approach to the discussion might be to use other marks june guidance question mark scheme indicative content material in amos such as the lofty concept of as creator to contradict the stimulus quotation
 marks the best responses are likely to come from candidates who have demonstrated accurate knowledge and some depth of understanding of the text in their exegesis
 to make the comparison some candidates might first summarise the background content and themes of the book of micah and of isaiah other candidates might identify similarities and differences from the start
 the specification encourages candidates to focus on the messianic hope but this is likely to be explained in the context of the rest of the content in both cases
 some might refer to isaiah from the reward and punishment section of the this is creditable but not essential for full marks
 micah prophesies the babylonian captivity of the sixth century and many scholars suggest that the book originally ended at some candidates may use such facts to raise issues about date authorship purpose and historicity if relevant to their arguments
 however excellent answers also may come from candidates who concentrate on the text to identify common themes and to discuss the extent to which the messianic ideas are similar or different or show development
 candidates might explain that the set chapters are part of a prologue which some scholars say is the latest part of the book probably the introduction is in praise of wisdom which is often personified
 sometimes she even speaks for herself most candidates are likely to take the opportunity to show familiarity with the set texts when addressing the question
 some might use material from their studies to explain about hohma wisdom literature and might refer to the book of job to show there are different types of this literature
 there seems no doubt that solomon was a patron of wisdom and candidates might know about archaeological finds and near eastern e
 responses are likely to include the superscription referring to solomon david and israel to address the question and show that the collections purport to be special to israel despite their similarity to texts from neighbouring countries
 candidates are likely to point out that the proverbs are more advice rather than religious homilies but they reflect the belief that all wisdom comes from e
 and not only is the fear of hashem the beginning of wisdom but wisdom speaks for herself and claims in to have been at the beginning of creative work
 candidates june guidance question mark scheme indicative content might interpret wisdom as the torah throughout the response and therefore as totally reflecting a jewish milieu
 marks some candidates might refer to christian commentators who link who finds me finds with concepts from gospel and the role of the logos at creation
 the modern distinction between knowledge and wisdom is useful but it is not always applicable to the set texts because the hebrew couplets sometimes use these words interchangeably to parallel each other
 whichever approach good responses are likely to show some familiarity with the content of the set texts and demonstrate some understanding of their significance
 some candidates might include relevant explanations about the chronology of events and the possible dates of the writing of the texts to attempt to elucidate their exegesis
 reward and punishment in relation to the covenant or in connection with the book of jonah from their studies and this is acceptable
 marks some candidates might argue that the teachings about reward and punishment have always been clear in the jewish scriptures and might cite examples where rewards the righteous and punishes the disobedient just like jeremiah and other prophets predicted
 the innocent suffering of job and the vicarious suffering of the servant might be used to counter or develop themes relevant to the stimulus statement
 teachings about the resurrection of the body daniel and about judgement and life after death ultimately extend teachings about reward and punishment beyond this life to include the hereafter

 his approach was and he had written with great affect as early as in an extensively read publication on issues which he believed need urgent the attention by his church
 source albeit by a traditional historian whose integrity has been questioned on modern german history also suggests that that was intention

 the significance of the dramatic events of the october days is that it showed that for many there lurked a deep hostility to the revolution
 it also showed continued faith in the king and a hope that once removed from those royal supporters surrounding and influencing him that he would help ordinary people

 some of the issues to consider may the phrase should be considered within the context of german foreign policy and the nazi soviet non aggression pact and the background to nazi soviet relations
 trade talks between germany and the soviet union had been in july the agreement that was signed represented a considerable diplomatic victory for hitler as britain and france were also attempting to reach an accord with russia
 he is trying here to reassure his commanders that he does not think that britain and france will act over poland now that an agreement has been signed with russia
 he feels that the leaders of the democratic states in europe are spineless and will never stand up to germany either diplomatically or militarily
 speech should be treated with caution because it is intended to win over those army commanders who were concerned about the prospect of war with britain and france if germany invaded poland
 clearly french security was the main focus of statement and he was highlighting to the other locarno powers the fact that hitler no longer feels bound by the treaty of versailles or the locarno pact
 his condemnation is limited however to verbal protest more about methods than at his aims because france had shown no decisive inclination to intervene following remilitarization of the rhineland
 furthermore flandin was relying upon stirring up the moral support of britain and italy in the face of this german threat because they were also the guarantors of locarno

 his view is targeted towards a european audience to highlight the lack of artistic freedom which might challenge nazi stereotypes
 goering is keen to justify the use of terror against enemies because he points out that the communist threat has been eradicated
 it is clear that in germany people are arrested before they commit crimes although goering is keen to point out that the creation of the state secret police was necessary
 how important was education for the candidates are expected to analyse and evaluate both the content and the authorship of the sources as part of an enquiry into the importance of education for the nazis
 in relation to the set enquiry and in their analysis of the sources candidates may consider some of the following source suggests that education was significant to the future of germany
 source reveals the significance of education for the nazis as it was revised to ensure that the minds of young people were nazified
 the importance of history for example was to give a nationalist slant and indoctrination became the principle goal rather than the acquisition of knowledge
 the illustration is taken from a nazified elementary reading textbook whose sole function was to propagandise nazi policy in all its forms and to brainwashing young people in germany
 the illustration portrays happy children under the nazi flag and is consistent with the view that children were expected to fulfil their roles in society
 as an eyewitness to the events the view of karl hartland is a subjective one which reflected the realities of education in third reich
 as a jew life in school would have become very difficult so the veracity of the source should be considered
 however this extract is not tainted with any jewish bias and the content is consistent with accepted beliefs about the importance of education in the third reich

 do you agree with the interpretation that the christian churches in germany supported the nazi candidates are expected to show an understanding of how aspects of the past have been interpreted in different ways
 answers will consider the content and authorship of the sources and use their own knowledge of other interpretations in making their judgement about the interpretation that the christian churches supported the nazi regime
 some of the issues to consider may candidates are invited to enter into a debate on whether or not the christian churches supported the nazi regime
 they should consider the motivation behind each source the interpretation in source suggests that the church showed a timid and half hearted response to the nazi regime
 this should give him some expertise in the matter especially since it is printed in a specialist book which usually carries some veracity because of the targeted audience
 there were significant sections of the clergy of all churches that found themselves sympathetic to many aspects of nazi ideology such as the anti communism of the regime
 however the validity of the interpretation in the question is challenged by the evidence of source in this source a local priest chaplin fath agitates against the hitler youth organisation
 this source supports the view that the church did not collaborate with the nazi regime and therefore challenges the validity of the interpretation
 the fact he is writing a report to the local gestapo might make him play with the truth which might affect the veracity of the source
 candidates will consider alternative interpretations such as there was no collective opposition to the nazis within the church or the fact that the church challenged aspects of nazi policy but not the regime itself
 do you agree with the interpretation that hitler took control of germany legally between candidates are expected to show an understanding of how aspects of the past have been interpreted in different ways
 arguably the steps taken by hitler did at times break the letter of the constitution but he was also able to reply upon the support of groups who sought to benefit from the nazi regime
 the day of potsdam presented the president and hitler working together legality and the vote on the enabling act used the structure of the weimar constitution
 source is from a nazi newspaper and suggests that the nazis have assumed control legally through a democratic vote and so supports the validity of the interpretation in the question
 they might argue that the nazi effectively seized power through a combination of terror and manipulation and willing collaboration as well as using a combination of legal measures

 christians believe that god knows everything about them and knows what is in their he would know what was really worrying them
 there is also an element of trust and faith when praying in the same way as you trust your friend
 some might say that god is so beyond human experience and knowledge that it is impossible to have the sort of relationship one would have with a friend

 candidates might consider some of the there may be some initial discussion as to whether a christian needs to attend church to be a this may have some impact on the answer
 it could be argued that people who do not attend church should not make vows in the presence of god as it is meaningless unless the person actually believes in god
 the presence of god is mentioned a number of times in the marriage service and the bride and groom will be making religious statements
 guidance question mark scheme answer some might doubt whether a person would take their vows seriously if they are happy to acknowledge god on this one occasion when they have not on any other
 surely they should be allowed to get married in a church if they wish as they do believe in god and jesus

 they may also try to spread the word of god as commanded by jesus so that everyone can benefit from words
 these additional books are the deuterocanonical books also known as the apocrypha the apocrypha was written mainly in the time between the old and new testaments
 when martin luther made his translation of the bible he removed the books of the apocrypha from the old testament canon and placed them separately between the old and new testament
 the reason why the protestant church decided not to include the books of the apocrypha in their canon the books of the apocrypha are not in the hebrew canon though they were included in the vulgate and the septuagint
 candidates might consider some of the some christians might say that christianity could not exist without the bible because it is the word of god and the source of all their information about god and jesus
 some might say that the written word is not important as christians know what is in the bible and these teachings and words could be passed on from generation to generation
 on the other hand the bible as it is today containing old and new testament was not available until at least years after the time of jesus
 during that time the early church grew and thrived and this was because the words of jesus were passed on by word of mouth
 however again it could be said though the first gospel was not written until about years after death within that time christianity had flourished without it

 examiners should also be prepared to award zero marks if the response is not worthy of credit according to the mark scheme
 where some judgement is required mark schemes will provide the principles by which marks will be awarded and exemplification may be limited
 when examiners are in doubt regarding the application of the mark scheme to a response the team leader must be consulted
 history marking guidance marking of levels of response the mark scheme provides an indication of the sorts of answer that might be found at different levels
 it is intended as a guide and it will be necessary therefore for examiners to use their professional judgement in deciding both at which level a question has been answered and how effectively points have been sustained
 candidates should always be rewarded according to the quality of thought expressed in their answer and not solely according to the amount of knowledge conveyed
 however candidates with only a superficial knowledge will be unable to develop or sustain points sufficiently to move to higher levels
 at the end of each answer examiners should look back on the answer as a whole in the light of these general criteria in order to ensure that the total mark reflects their overall impression of the worth
 deciding on the mark point within a level the first stage is to decide the overall level and then whether the work represents high mid or low performance within the level
 one stronger passage at level would not by itself merit a level award but it would be evidence to support a high level award unless there were also substantial weaknesses in other areas
 assessing quality of written communication qowc will have a bearing if the qowc is inconsistent with the communication descriptor for the level in which the answer falls
 if for example a history response displays mid level criteria but fits the level qowc descriptors it will require a move down within the level
 these will be supported by limited factual material which has some accuracy and relevance although not directed at the focus of the question
 they will however include material which is either descriptive and thus only implicitly relevant to the focus or which strays from that focus
 candidates offer an analytical response which relates well to the focus of the question and which shows some understanding of the key issues contained in it
 the candidate will demonstrate the skills needed to produce convincing extended writing but there may be passages which lack clarity or coherence
 candidates offer an analytical response which directly addresses the focus of the question and which demonstrates explicit understanding of the key issues contained in it
 mid level marks as per descriptor high level marks the qualities of level are securely material is convincing in range and depth consistent with level the exposition will be controlled and the deployment logical
 thus most candidates whose historical understanding related to a given question suggests that they should sit in a particular level will express that understanding in ways which broadly conform to the communication descriptor appropriate to that level
 indicators of written communication are best considered normatively and may be used to help decide a specific mark to be awarded within a level
 quality of written communication which fails to conform to the descriptor for the level will depress the award of marks by a within the level
 responses may refer to his position as king of piedmont in appointing cavour encouraging the war of accepting the states of naples and sicily at teano in and his subsequent role as the king of italy
 these answers may establish that he was more than a by contrasting his role with the more direct contributions of individuals such as cavour and garibaldi or by reference to foreign influence
 these answers will establish arguments in a broadly balanced response while the best may attempt to evaluate extent or integrate the arguments into an overall judgement

 this lack of influence might be highlighted for example by the suggestion that economic factors were of greater influence or that it was not until after that the forces which would lead to eventual unification began to emerge

 when he had violated that liberty by arresting the three bishops it had put him on trial and forced him to appeal to rome
 there can be no doubt that the doctrines of high papalism had taken root in england and the authority of the church was greater than it had ever been
 to a certain extent this ascendancy of the church was a natural consequence of the weakness of the crown but it also reflected a personal inequality
 everything he did was on a grand even his failings as a bishop his military activities the magnificence of his castles and the promotion of his relatives were positively regal
 he was a man of infinite capacity and if his mother adela had lived to see his full development she must surely have repented of her decision to make him a monk
 stephen on the other hand was cast in the image of his father a man of great activity but little judgement
 he had come to the throne at a time when civil war was almost inevitable and the need was for a king of heroic proportions
 although he was an excellent warrior and showed enterprise and speed in the beginning of campaigns and sieges he too often failed to complete and although he seemed cheerful and gay beneath the surface he was mistrustful and sly
 he was basically and as a result he did not inspire the devotion which his grandfather william the conqueror even his biographer the author of the gesta stephani found him colourless
 he died on october and was buried beside his wife and son in the choir of the cluniac abbey which he had founded at faversham
 it was the longest interval between the death of an english king and the coronation of his successor for more than a hundred years
 the aim was no longer to choose the most eligible royal candidate but to accept the man who was the lawful heir that is to say the one with the best hereditary claim

 chance and coincidence played their things might have been very different for example if the irish rebellion had not happened at the precise time it did
 only pym and a few close friends saw the matter in totally different for them the parliamentary cause was the destruction of a conspiracy that struck at the core of the life
 triumph was that by imposing his own fears of popery so sweepingly on the population he had many really believe that the papists were kindling a civil war
 sir bevil grenville so the story went visited most of the papist gentry of cornwall and devon in disguise to raise men and money for the king
 sense of identification with parliament became a defensive reaction for mps and as petitions to parliament show around the country
 these petitions began to pile up since petitioning from the counties exemplified the complex relationship between parliaments and the gentry communities of the shires
 he said would put him the hands of a few malignant persons who have entered into a combination to destroy his misunderstanding of his aims and motives would have been less serious if his character had been different
 for all this any account of the origins of the civil war which fails to give due weight to its ideological content must be incomplete
 if fear and distrust at the centre of the affairs finally made war unavoidable there was surely something more positive which drove men to take up arms against their own countrymen

 strategic explanations of imperialism have tried to account for the british expansion in africa in terms of the need to defend the routes to india
 it is also true that the disintegration of local power in some areas crucial for this purpose such as egypt drew the british into establishing a much greater direct political presence than originally intended and even into actual rule
 in the first place they underestimate the directly economic incentive to acquire some african territories of which southern africa is the most obvious
 in the second place they overlook the fact that india was the jewel in the imperial and the core of british global strategic thinking precisely because of her very real importance to the british economy
 this was never greater than in the latter part of the nineteenth century when anything up to per cent of british cotton exports went to india and the far east
 india was the key per cent went to india alone and the international balance of payments of britain hinged on the payments surplus which india provided
 and finally the attempt to prove that nothing in the internal development of western capitalism in the explains the territorial redivision of the world fails
 however there is no good evidence that colonial conquest had much bearing on the employment or real incomes of most workers in britain
 however not a great deal of successful defence of its global economic dominance had much to do with the imperialist expansion
 most of overseas success was due to a more systematic exploitation of already existing possessions or of the special position as the major importer from and investor in areas which were virtually independent like latin america
 yet the british aim was not expansion but defence against others encroaching upon territories dominated by british trade and british capital

 has this approach any disadvantages or turn over the debate over british appeasement in the read the following extract about appeasement and then answer the questions that follow
 the nub of the debate lies in the evaluation both of intentions whether he determined on war or whether he took the opportunities offered by western leaders and of the intentions behind policy formation in britain and france
 with a few exceptions the limits of british power the constrictions imposed by military weakness overseas commitments the policy of the dominions and the isolationism of the united states have not been fully taken into account
 the opening of the british archives to under the rule now makes possible a fuller analysis of how the chamberlain government understood the international situation
 coherent policy towards germany had emerged by which can be best described as the search for an detente backed by the use of an efficient bomber air force as a deterrent
 neville foreign policy after he became prime minister in appears from a study of the cabinet archives to have been a much more radical departure from this earlier tradition than has usually been described
 the logical consequence was a curious blend of withdrawal from europe and heightened sensitivity to possible causes of european war
 thereafter the government hoped to be free to make more positive overtures to germany to appease her grievances and reach a settlement on the basis not of fear by deterrence but of mutual interests and separate spheres of influence
 in his failure to come to terms with the ideological motivation of german foreign policy chamberlain was no more culpable than baldwin or eden but assurance comes nearer to the sin of pride
 his wholly admirable horror of war cannot outweigh the fact that in the last resort chamberlain avoided the full responsibility of choice by referring to personal standards of morality which were not universal qualities
 nevertheless if the chamberlain government regarded the security of france as an essential interest then their treatment of their ally was unwise and probably deeply harmful
 finally the government may be condemned for the way in which the foreign office and military experts were overridden or sidetracked

 the yellow wallpaper deals with imagination in an unusual and vivid way and there will be a lot of scope for candidates to consider the plight of the narrator in this respect
 the text chosen to develop the line of argument is likely to enhance the discussion exploring the ways lesser characters are used in the novels
 there are a number of significant lesser characters in the french woman many of which could feature in a discussion of their importance
 the significance of technique must not be overlooked here aspects of the narrative such as tone and mood imagery symbolism narrative voice and language choice could be considered
 the yellow wallpaper has fewer lesser characters of course but the role of john is a significant one and worthy of consideration
 here too there needs to be a discussion of the ways in which character is created if the candidate is to succeed
 candidates are likely to take issue with the proposition in developing their argument with this text this is of course to be rewarded where it succeeds
 the color purple provides plenty of scope for general discussion as well as for specific focus on events and characters in the book
 the argument may examine how drama and dramatic situations are developed in each novel exploring the purposes and effects of their use
 drama is a significant aspect of the scarlet letter figuring largely in many key scenes from first appearance on the scaffold to the death of dimmesdale
 candidates should have plenty of opportunity to discuss the roles of techniques such as setting irony dialogue and imagery and symbolism in engendering drama here
 the color purple also offers a good deal of drama and many dramatic scenes from the graphic depictions of childhood onward
 the techniques in evidence here are also straightforward enough imagery and symbolism dialogue narrative voice and perspective and irony for example
 candidates who simply list or describe dramatic scenes and situations are far less likely to prosper than those who focus on technique primarily
 in the shooting party we are also given a strong picture of a specific tranche of society and the impact of progress upon it as far as that goes
 it may be concluded that there is little sense of progress here but that some form of it being inevitable is suggested by aspects of the foreshadowing and symbolism for example
 in order to meet the requirement there should be specific comment on technique and method in the presentation of the terms of the question lead to this
 the techniques used to present these are the same plainly as in howards end though here the significance of the narrative voice is more worthy of specific consideration perhaps
 there are also less obvious aspects of the narrative to consider here however as is the case with the remains of the day
 responses which adopt a linear approach and ignore the importance of technique are far less likely to succeed at the higher levels
 presents undeveloped comments makes some appropriate use of literary terms and concepts writes with some clarity and with some technical lapses shows some engagement
 provides a sustained analysis of the use and selection of features of structure form and language showing a welldeveloped critical understanding effectively demonstrates how structure form and language shape meaning in a clear argument

 examiners should also be prepared to award zero marks if the response is not worthy of credit according to the mark scheme
 where some judgement is required mark schemes will provide the principles by which marks will be awarded and exemplification may be limited
 when examiners are in doubt regarding the application of the mark scheme to a response the team leader must be consulted
 history marking guidance marking of levels of response the mark scheme provides an indication of the sorts of answer that might be found at different levels
 it is intended as a guide and it will be necessary therefore for examiners to use their professional judgement in deciding both at which level a question has been answered and how effectively points have been sustained
 candidates should always be rewarded according to the quality of thought expressed in their answer and not solely according to the amount of knowledge conveyed
 however candidates with only a superficial knowledge will be unable to develop or sustain points sufficiently to move to higher levels
 at the end of each answer examiners should look back on the answer as a whole in the light of these general criteria in order to ensure that the total mark reflects their overall impression of the worth
 deciding on the mark point within a level the first stage is to decide the overall level and then whether the work represents high mid or low performance within the level
 one stronger passage at level would not by itself merit a level award but it would be evidence to support a high level award unless there were also substantial weaknesses in other areas
 assessing quality of written communication qowc will have a bearing if the qowc is inconsistent with the communication descriptor for the level in which the answer falls
 if for example a history response displays mid level criteria but fits the level qowc descriptors it will require a move down within the level
 these will be supported by limited factual material which has some accuracy and relevance although not directed at the focus of the question
 they will however include material which is either descriptive and thus only implicitly relevant to the focus or which strays from that focus
 candidates offer an analytical response which relates well to the focus of the question and which shows some understanding of the key issues contained in it
 the candidate will demonstrate the skills needed to produce convincing extended writing but there may be passages which lack clarity or coherence
 candidates offer an analytical response which directly addresses the focus of the question and which demonstrates explicit understanding of the key issues contained in it
 mid level marks as per descriptor high level marks the qualities of level are securely material is convincing in range and depth consistent with level the exposition will be controlled and the deployment logical
 thus most candidates whose historical understanding related to a given question suggests that they should sit in a particular level will express that understanding in ways which broadly conform to the communication descriptor appropriate to that level
 indicators of written communication are best considered normatively and may be used to help decide a specific mark to be awarded within a level
 quality of written communication which fails to conform to the descriptor for the level will depress the award of marks by a within the level

 in considering the stated factor answers may refer to landing with a substantial force and his victory at fulford gate which caused the loss of thousands of english soldiers
 rapid march north was followed by his victory at stamford bridge but again with the loss of valuable troops
 landing at pevensey forced harold to return to london with an army exhausted by its efforts at stamford bridge and by the rapid march south
 in considering other factors answers may refer to the course of the battle of the different qualities of the opposing armies with a largely peasant saxon army facing a disciplined norman and papal support displayed via the gonfanon
 godwinson made a significant error by failing to wait for reinforcements from the midlands which might have turned the battle in his favour
 leadership was a significant factor in contributing to the norman victory and answers may refer to his long military and political experience within normandy in shaping that victory

 there is likely to be more material offered on henry and becket but level answers must refer to both henry and john
 answers may note intention to reduce the growing power of the church and his reasons for promoting becket to the see of canterbury
 the growing divisions between the king and his archbishop were both personal and both men differed fundamentally about the extent of the respective powers of church and state
 determination to restore royal power over the church led to the constitutions of clarendon of beckett refused to accept these limitations on church power and fled to flanders

 number indicative content mark the question is focused on the reign of richard and the extent to which the involvement in the third crusade weakened royal control over both england and the angevin territories in france
 examiners should not expect an answer balanced equally between english and angevin lands but for level answers must refer to both
 choice as justiciar william longchamps proved insensitive to english customs and traditions and was forced from office by john and senior nobles
 after his release from the custody richard was forced to remain in france for much of the rest of his reign in order to resist designs on the angevin lands

 from black death to great england question number indicative content mark the question is focused on economic and social conditions in england in the years and the extent to which these were changed by successive plagues during that period
 the question is concerned with change over time and information which considers factors other than economic and social conditions is likely to be irrelevant
 the fall in the size of the population had a dramatic impact on the agricultural economy with the shortage of labour encouraging greater mobility among workers on land
 the collapse in agricultural rents caused both economic and social change and enabled many to convert from labourers to independent farmers
 the fall in the number of skilled artisans a rapid decline in rents and the disappearance of many markets all hit towns and the urban economy badly
 there was a significant impact on trade links with france the low countries and the baltic which weakened the economies of coastal towns
 answers may also note the failure to maintain existing social structures through for example the ordinance and statute of labourers and the sumptuary laws
 at high level and within level answers should consider the extent to which these changes were dramatic and may note that some of the factors mentioned above contributed to the outbreak of the revolt
 level answers will address the question well and will begin to consider the nature and extent of change but the selection of material consideration of the focus may lack balance or be less secure
 level answers will attempt analysis with some understanding of the focus of the question probably by addressing matters such as agricultural decline
 however the supporting material is likely to be descriptive or lacking in depth and relevance in places and there may be some inaccuracies
 level answers will offer some relevant simple statements about the question asked supported by limited though broadly accurate material in places
 number indicative content mark the question is focused on the revolt of and the extent to which this was caused by growing hostility towards landowners
 the statute of labourers was seen as one part of a concerted policy aimed at maintaining traditional feudal rights which a growing number of peasants were refusing to render
 the revolt was centred on essex east anglia and kent where there were many small free and landowners who resented the power of the manorial lords
 one of the chief demands made by the peasants in was the abolition of the villeinage and labour legislation and violence in these counties was largely aimed at agents of royal and noble authority

 henry and henry question number indicative content mark the question is focused on the english campaigns in france in the years and the extent to which the weaknesses of french forces were responsible for english successes
 in considering the stated factor candidates may note that while french forces were often much larger than the english armies they were largely disorganised indisciplined and suffered from poor leadership
 there was no unified command or clear tactics perhaps because the french felt certain of victory against an apparently small and weakened english force
 french forces were packed so tightly together that they proved ineffective in the early stages of the battle especially against the english archers
 these may be explained by the absence of effective french leadership and the inability of the french to mount a serious challenge to henry forces
 other relevant factors which explain english successes include skills of planning and leadership shown in the early stages of the campaign in the investment and occupation of harfleur
 level answers will address the question well and will begin to consider the given factor and some others but the selection of material consideration of the focus may lack balance or be less secure
 level answers will offer some relevant simple statements about the question asked supported by limited though broadly accurate material in places
 number indicative content mark the question is focused on the recovery of french fortunes in the years and the extent to which the influence of joan of arc contributed to that improvement
 joan of arc met the dauphin at chinon persuading him to send her to orleans where she played some part in the lifting of the siege
 she was also instrumental in persuading the dauphin to be crowned charles at reims in an act which greatly strengthened the authority and prestige
 intervention came at a time when the english hold on their french territories was becoming overstretched with insufficient forces to maintain their positions
 answers may note that while military intervention was modest she appealed to the french people and soldiers and made a permanent difference in reviving the morale of charles supporters
 other relevant factors which explain the revival of french fortunes include the minority of henry and the divided leadership of bedford in france and gloucester in england
 answers may also note the significance of events in the death of bedford and the ending of the burgundian alliance were both major blows to the lancastrian regime
 level candidates will address the question well and will begin to consider the given factor and some others but the selection of material consideration of the focus may lack balance or be less secure
 level answers will offer some relevant simple statements about the question asked supported by limited though broadly accurate material in places
 he was victorious at the first battle of st albans in may though he had few military successes thereafter and in he was defeated and killed at wakefield
 his son the earl of march displayed great military skills and his leadership qualities were displayed in the decisive victory at towton in set against the successes of the yorkists were the weaknesses and failures of the lancastrians
 henry proved unable to rule or even to make decisions and he possessed none of the military or political skills required for the late mediaeval king
 the capture of henry at northampton in proved a major blow to the lancastrians and was a factor which allowed march to take the throne the following year
 level candidates will address the question well and will begin to analyse reasons for yorkist success but the selection of material consideration of the focus may lack balance or be less secure

 however the supporting material is likely to be descriptive or lacking in depth and relevance in places and there may be some inaccuracies

 number indicative content mark the question is focused on the end of the yorkist monarchy in and the extent to which richard was responsible for his own downfall
 the southern gentry resented growing dependence on his northern allies while increasing financial demands and failure in scotland only added to the unpopularity

 son of god links may be found most clearly in the exorcism of jesus is called of the most high candidates may discuss motives and the significance of a gentile uttering these words
 june guidance candidates may use miracles from any gospel but are most likely to focus on the miracles in the set texts in mark
 question mark scheme indicative content candidates may wish to show their knowledge miracle workers such as honi and hanina ben dosa might be used to show how miracles were viewed at the time of jesus
 mark candidates may wish to highlight the ambiguity of the miracles and show how they do not have one clear christological message
 some responses might assess other aspects of ministry as comparable or more important in showing the true identity of jesus
 june guidance question mark scheme indicative content candidates may look at attitude to the law and iota or dot shall pass from the as a prelude to a consideration of the antitheses
 some may refer to work who sees perfection and imitatio dei differentiation reciprocity and eschatological reward as key ethical principles underpinning the antitheses
 candidates may also look at the role of love in the sermon the golden rule and other specific teachings in the latter parts of the sermon
 views on the sermon as an eschatological interim ethic might be analysed as to whether or not they are helpful to an understanding of teaching
 this might involve mark june guidance question mark scheme indicative content consideration of other and evaluation of the comparative or complementary importance of other aspects of teaching ministry

 mark candidates are likely to explain what the delay in the meant in terms of jewish apocalyptic and eschatological expectation about the kingdom of god at the time of jesus
 candidates are likely to explain evidence for the delay of the parousia and ways in which luke deals with the problem
 they are likely to explain his notion of salvation history and how luke divides history into three distinct periods in order to push the parousia to the distant future
 mark the evaluation might explore with evidence from the text whether the key realised eschatological sayings in luke are a successful way of dealing with the problem
 there are many futuristic sayings and there is no certainty that luke replaces the future element of the kingdom with a realised eschatology
 some candidates might argue that the delay in the parousia was more a concern of the early church and it concerned the gospel writers including luke to a lesser extent
 what might appear to be confused teaching in the gospel could be explained as the product of redactors attempting to impose a timescale on the kingdom or revise sayings
 candidates might discuss the various criteria that scholars have established to ascertain which parts if any of the gospels show the authentic jesus
 such criteria as multiple attestation embarrassment discontinuity coherence rejection cultural and religious environment accounts and vivid june guidance question mark scheme indicative content description might be explained and analysed with relevant examples from the text in the synoptic gospels
 other evidence in ancient historical sources might be commented upon in terms of its support or contradiction of events in the gospel
 candidates might assess how useful some of the criteria suggested by scholars actually are in determining what can be known of the historical jesus and establishing historical jesus traditions
 it might be concluded that none of the criteria are foolproof but they might be viewed as a loose framework for historical accuracy

 his resolution was strengthened by news of disasters from the front as prussia entered the war and prepared to invade french territory
 parisian popular pressure had contributed to the sense of being kept a prisoner in the city after october by early many deputies were also starting to feel a sense of entrapment

 by armies were stretched across theatres of operation that ranged from iberia to italy to the north german coast and there was also the major campaign against austrian regulars
 at marengo roughly soldiers had taken part on both sides but at leipzig the total number exceeded by the time of wagram the battles were too large and uncontrollable for one man to oversee
 napoleon resorted to the continental system in an effort to undermine naval power by economic weapons undermining british trade and her commercial prosperity
 it was a vicious circle of conquest and resistance which british trade could survive so long as the other continents of the world were open to it
 the allies lost killed and wounded but they had wrested control of germany from the french who could only retreat rapidly to the rhine leaving soldiers besieged in german fortresses
 the only hope for napoleon was that austria prussia and russia would quarrel over the future of germany and poland and undermine their own alliance
 intense british diplomatic activity at the allied courts led by the earl of aberdeen resulted in a treaty whereby the allies agreed to continue the war until europe was free of french control
 challenging protest reform and response in britain sources for use with question strong the story of britain published the five years following brought britain nearer to the brink of revolution than at any other time in history
 at one meeting on st field in manchester the local yeomanry dispersed the crowd and people were killed immediately billed as martyrs to the cause
 the radical groups were diverse and divided but more significant was the fact that saw a sharp upturn in the economy
 the talk of insurrection and revolution which was widespread throughout the north at this time had not been initiated by oliver the spy
 moreover it could be argued that the government with its repressive legislation and to such episodes as the march of the blanketeers contributed significantly to popular disenchantment and forced moderate reformers underground
 for example the spencean revolutionaries at spa fields in december spoke of a committee of public safety and they paraded the tricolour of the future british republic
 moreover when britain emerged as the victor against france this not only enhanced the prestige the problems brought by but also deprived potential revolutionaries of outside assistance
 the threat of revolution in britain therefore was greatly reduced by furthermore although there was much discontent among the demobilised the armed forces remained loyal

 in terms of the moral virtues humans should strive to achieve the goal of the of each virtue which is developed through habit
 the deontological aspects could stated that in order to try and become a humans have a duty to develop certain moral and intellectual virtues which were excellences of character and mind
 this is an ability which separates us from other species and is an activity of the humans also have a duty to create a society in which these virtues are able to flourish
 an approach allows people to develop their own sense of morality whereas universal moral norms are impossible to develop in a society
 without such freedom there can be no discussion of morality as morality necessarily presupposes the ability to choose between right or wrong and to think rationally
 when we are motivated by the pure form of the moral law in which case our will achieves an extraordinary form of purity being determined to act independently of all inclinations and even all expected consequences
 when we are motivated by the pure form of the moral example of autonomous will whereby one is governed by a law that originates in our will itself
 it was the idea that humankind can think rationally which led to his development of the categorical imperative in its three main forms universality impartiality and rationality
 he contrasted this with a heteronomous will whereby one is governed by natural forces lying outside oneself this means we are motivated by desires or inclinations in which case our motivation is fundamentally egoistic and hedonistic
 when we are motivated by desires or inclinations our will allows itself to be passively governed by nature by the world of appearances and one cannot be a moral agent
 maximum level if no reference made to definition of moral statements as and therefore absolute is evaluate this contention
 for example is could be an example of knowledge yet observation from history shows that may have been times when was the right response

 the rejection of all violence military conflict and war as means of solving any crisis and embracing and reconciliation both by individuals and states

 very premature baby should never be allowed to die if human intervention could keep it evaluate this contention with reference to at least one major world religion

 according to kantian ethics if you can universalise the maxim that human persons have a right to then if the premature baby is considered to be a it has the right to exist
 utilitarian might well argue that attempting to keep the very premature baby alive might not fulfil the happiness for the greatest ltd

 the question of whether gentiles should keep to mosiac law was discussed by the and after founding a church paul did not interfere with its administration except when he was asked to give an opinion
 in such cases he was always careful to distinguish between the authoritative words of jesus and his own judgement

 the first quest culminates with harnack and begins its decline with schweitzer and kähler who reconstructed jesus as a selfdeluded jewish apocalypticist
 however some of students käsemann and reasoned that the jesus who actually existed must have some connection to christianity but under the influence of current philosophy they tended to think of him as a existentialist whose teaching was inaccessible
 good examples are jesus seminar which interprets jesus as a wandering and sanders who interprets him as a jew with an erroneous eschatological vision
 however it is at least evident that the historical jesus opposed the oppressive society of his day associated with outcasts and proclaimed a kingdom of god characterised by compassion

 level demonstrate understanding of the past through explanation analysis and arriving at substantiated judgements key concepts such as causation consequence continuity change and significance within an historical the relationships between key features and characteristics of the periods studied
 source evaluation is reasonably full and appropriate but lacks completeness on the issues raised by the sources in the light of the question
 june provides a comparison but there is unevenness confining the comparison to the second half of the answer or simply to a concluding paragraph
 source evaluation is partial and it is likely that the provenance itself is not compared may be undeveloped or merely commented on discretely
 identifies some comparative points but is very sequential and perhaps implicit comment on the sources is basic general undeveloped or juxtaposed often through poorly understood quotation
 demonstrate understanding of the past through explanation analysis and arriving at substantiated judgements key concepts such as causation consequence continuity change and significance within an historical the relationships between key features and characteristics of the periods studied

 is aware of some of the limitations of the sources individually or as a group but mostly uses them for reference and to illustrate an argument rather than analysing and evaluating them as evidence
 question mark scheme answer the context is the problem alexius faced from the crusading in the form of their armies for the holy land source frankish armies a weakened empire
 did his reaction reflect an honourable character or a duplicitous the sources are similar in content in that they agree the frankish armies are problematic
 he was failed to rescue an ally from an ambush and resorted to poison to reduce the army of a leader who was supposedly on the same side as he was
 his one concern was to gain homage and subservience using the army as vassals to recapture lost byzantine territory neutering any army that was too large to control
 in contrast source is a defence of alexius who is depicted as doing the best he could for his empire in difficult circumstances
 although seeing the potential of the franks as allies he also sees them as a potential threat needing careful and tactful control if he and the byzantines were to survive
 source sees the unfortunate behemond as the particular victim of whilst anna in makes no mention of him simply smearing all crusaders as greedy and duplicitous as they do alexius
 context might suggest that behemond was not lacking in the devious stakes himself and is certainly not the innocent portrayed here by the provenance and context of the sources should be used to evaluate these similarities and differences
 william of malmesbury was an english monk writing very much from information received based on hearsay such as the account of alexius poisoning rivers
 he never visited byzantium or the east and clearly had little sympathy for eastern christianity and none at all for alexius
 mark scheme june question answer demonstrates through his tone what rapidly became the perceived wisdom in the west on alexius that of a tricky and devious eastern emperor
 however she was certainly closer to events had access to byzantine sources and the leisure to use them fully and is likely to be preferred as a judge of character
 both sources provide only hints at the subtext here although they again agree that alexius is an accomplished diplomat whether they approve or not
 the supporting view that the relationship was a hostile one is partially found in peter the crusade and to an extent in anna comnena but particularly in william of malmesbury
 the supporting argument in source is that the emperor was not impressed by the behaviour of horde and so moved them on rapidly leading to their defeat
 anna in source is aware that her father was not happy at the arrival of a large frankish army and comments very negatively upon the greed of the crusaders
 source considers the relationship to be entirely hostile because of the duplicitous nature of alexius in his relations with crusader leaders notably bohemond and william of poitou
 much of this hostility came down to a feeling by the franks that the crusaders were being used to regain lost byzantine territory together with a certain religious and a personal stereotyping by both sides
 successful answers will need to make use of all five sources testing them against contextual knowledge and evaluating their strengths and weaknesses and limitations as evidence
 source shows that alexius gave the crusade sound advice and yet they provoked his anger inexcusably through theft and misplaced zeal and then suffered from the terrain and the heat hardly his fault
 despite his worries they were and in direct opposition to the allegations made by william of malmesbury in of comparison with source might suggest alexius was justified in his views on plunder and theft
 source suggests alexius was ready for a friendly relationship up to and indeed had cultivated one but the sheer numbers of the crusaders would have alarmed him as source indicates
 the emperor was prepared to be june marks guidance question mark scheme answer operative and it might be considered effective evidence that the initial relationship was warily good degenerating only when faced with each other in practice
 william of malmesbury in was a careful researcher but from his english monastery is unlikely to have accurate information or at least would be affected by the pro frankish gloss attached to the sources he was using
 however he backs his views with specific instances some of dubious authenticity and there were issues between alexius and bohemond in particular although william of malmesbury only gives one side of this
 source illustrates that alexius had been on good terms with some crusaders and his appeal at piacenza was heard without hostility even if the first to arrive was the disorderly rabble led by peter
 source refers to luther as a for nothing forgetting his duty of obedience to the roman church and source to luther disobeying the order to come to rome
 knowledge of correspondence between luther and the pope might be used to evaluate their early relationship compared to the rather abusive exchanges between luther and prierias and luther and eck
 source suggests that luther added to his heresies instead of returning to obedience to the church and source refers to leo again reminding him patiently in writing to end his errors
 knowledge might be used to evaluate the likely consequences of luther going to rome in the light of determination to treat him as a heretic i
 by burning him despite support from frederick of saxony and the wider german populace by source asserts that the pope reprimanded luther through messengers while source is a set of instructions to one of these messengers cajetan
 in neither source is there any hint that leo was prepared to compromise or see point of view he merely states in source that he wished to prove him wrong when criticising papal law
 source differs from source in attitude as leo tries to defend and justify the laws made by his papal predecessors who never made errors
 the sources can be in different ways and as part of their judgement candidates will need to appreciate this
 supported judgement should be reached on the relative value of the sources as evidence taking into consideration provenance and content in context
 mark scheme june question answer source angry and emotive more spontaneous language in the private letter to cajetan is very different from source where the official tone is more measured and persuasive to appear reasonable and regretful
 this was to retain the support of those who had not taken side and attract back those who may have done so
 it is the language of a papal bull concerned to show that leo over three years had tried to persuade luther of his errors
had marks guidance the sources contain references to both sides of the argument so they may be grouped according to their view
 sources and to an extent the content of and are useful for the supporting view that both luther and the pope wished to settle their dispute peacefully
 sources and the nature and purpose of are useful for the opposing view that the dispute was too bitter to be settled peacefully
 sources and are useful for the supporting view and might be linked to source sources and suggest that luther wished to settle his dispute with rome peacefully
 in source luther says that he did not intend the theses to be widely published for all to read but that they were intended merely for academic discussion
 in source he likewise submits the successful answers will need to make use of all five sources testing them against contextual knowledge and evaluating their strengths and weaknesses any limitations as evidence
 the fact that leo calls him a in source confirms some support from his order yet he had yet to be sure of frederick of favour
 therefore in source luther himself is making use of the printing press to publish his own version of what he had said with the purpose of gaining support
 thus the reliability of sources and on the question of a peaceful settlement with luther perhaps concern over publicity in and using it in might be brought into question
 source and to a lesser extent sources and suggest that the pope june marks guidance the mark scheme and conclusion is expected
 no set overall in evaluation of the interpretation it might be concluded that both sides held their ground and there was never the possibility of a peaceful settlement while luther challenged papal power
 this propaganda in part of a bull condemning luther for heresy and excommunicating him as he had suggested earlier in source extends to safe to rome
 therefore it might be suggested that view is unconvincing as like luther he would not compromise and that was the only way to reach a peaceful settlement of their dispute
 sources and the nature and purpose of are useful for the opposing view that the dispute was too bitter to be settled peacefully
 likewise knowledge of burning of the bull might be used to evaluate how peaceful their relationship was at this time

 this mark scheme includes any amendments made at the standardisation events which all examiners participate in and is the scheme which was used by them in this examination
 the standardisation process ensures that the mark scheme covers the responses to questions and that every examiner understands and applies it in the same correct way
 as preparation for standardisation each examiner analyses a number of alternative answers not already covered by the mark scheme are discussed and legislated for
 if after the standardisation process examiners encounter unusual answers which have not been raised they are required to refer these to the principal examiner
 it must be stressed that a mark scheme is a working document in many cases further developed and expanded on the basis of reactions to a particular paper
 assumptions about future mark schemes on the basis of one document should be whilst the guiding principles of assessment remain constant details will change depending on the content of a particular examination paper
 verbal answers in english the basic principle of assessment is that candidates should gain credit for what they know understand and can do
 however these aspects are an integral part of assessing communication and marks cannot be awarded where errors in spelling punctuation or grammar lead to a failure to communicate the required information without ambiguity

 where numbered lines are given within a of a question credit should be given for correct answers no matter which line they appear on
 where a question has more than one section a candidate may include as part of the answer to one section the information required to answer another section

 in the marking scheme each question is provided with a brief outline of the likely content lines of argument of a answer but this is by no means prescriptive or exhaustive
 examiners must not attempt to reward answers according to the extent to which they match the structure of the outline or mention the points it contains
 the specification is designed to allow teachers to approach the content of modules in a variety of ways from any of a number of perspectives and answers must be assessed in the light of this flexibility of approach
 it is quite possible for an excellent and valid answer to contain knowledge and arguments which do not appear in the each answer must be assessed on its own merits according to the levels of response
 mark scheme june key skill of this is assessed at both advanced subsidiary and as an integral part of the marking scheme
 mark scheme june candidates must answer only one question from part and one question from part question indicative content marks candidates might begin by considering the effects of the fall on the human condition
 concupiscence is the manifestation of the rebellious will in all areas of human existence where lust for food sex and power are manifest
 whereas for example adam and eve lived as friends in eden and were able to have sex without lust the will now is distorted and weakened and unable to control the desires of the body
 some might explain how ambivalent attitude to friendship led him to conclude that even true friendship with people of own sex might never be possible
 humans are neither good nor bad but create their environment and their relationships according to the time and circumstances they find themselves in
 some might refer to existentialist writers such as sartre to support this humans are born with no prior nature or but their own paths
 mark scheme question indicative content marks june guidance on the other hand even the existentialists acknowledge that some actions lack authenticity and are the result of this suggests that humans do things which are not good for themselves
 candidates might begin by explaining that christians have very different ways of understanding what is meant by authority of scripture because some regard the as god and others humans
 for fundamentalist christians holy spirit is the author of the bible who reveals word to certain humans who are then inspired to write
 finally some might explain that a response to the authority of the bible covers all those who place the emphasis on the human response to god
 some might agree that as the bible was written some considerable time ago in historical and cultural situations very different from our own it therefore has no authority to determine how we should think or behave today
 dawkins and the go so far as to claim that the bible is a source of abuse and is dangerous morality from a bygone era
 in fact it is because it was written at a time very different from our own that it can ideas which a contemporary text might be unable to do
 candidates might begin by considering the purpose of base communities which developed as a perceived failure of the church in latin america to offer pastoral and practical help to communities where the parish priest was unable to be present
 the or was appointed to carry out some of the functions of the priest with a small number of people who formed themselves into a group
 mark scheme question indicative content marks theologically the base community is justified as an embodiment of the principle that theology should emerge from the poor and the material conditions of oppression
 they also reflect command to form communities of not based on relationships and seen clearly in acts where the first christians shared all with each other
 this might be because latin america as a whole has become more democratic and therefore base communities are less relevant
 some might argue that it is because base communities have created a whole generation of animators who have become local leaders that they have ironically lost out
 candidates may choose from a range of possible liberative theologies which might black theology black african theology dalit theology mujerista feminist womanist gay liberation theology
 candidates should explain the historical setting and of the main themes such as the causes and reasons for alienation and the process of conscientisation and key biblical texts and unique ideas of that particular theology
 they might agree that it has turned the kingdom of god into a political condition not a they might consider that it is too exclusively on the side of the poor
 on the other hand they might argue that the ideas of liberation theology have been absorbed into mainstream catholic social theology

 mark scheme june candidates must answer only one question from part and one question from part question indicative content marks candidates may begin with debate with brunner over natural theology and revelation
 to all of this barth famously replied the material image of god is too corrupt to enable any aspect of conscience to be open to god
 his rejection of natural theology coupled with his rejection of religion is often translated as and the uniqueness of the word as revealed in jesus christ all support this interpretation
 they might refer to analysis where he argues that religion in essence is human experience of nature for feuerbach there is no revelation only human existential response to deeper experiences which are then frequently falsely objectified
 having observed those phenomena which are considered to be religious he then proposes six dimensions of all religions of which the is the most basic one the second part of the essay question concerns truth and falsehood
 religions might be true or false according to feuerbach only in so far as they are genuine existential expressions
 mark scheme question indicative content marks june guidance some might argue that even smart distinguishes between religions which give a better account of the other than those which are merely mystical or magical
 feminism of this type begins with the simple observation that as women are as equally rational as men then politically educationally and economically there should no discrimination
 to what extent have feminist theologians successfully responded to the challenges of secular liberal any feminist theological response reconstructionist radical named feminist to secular liberal feminism is acceptable
 most candidates will probably explain how liberal analysis of the bible begins by placing it in its historical context and evaluating how it challenged the moral and spiritual values of its day
 for example some argue that there is a beginning with genesis and women both made equally in the image of through jeremiah to galatians christ
 on the one hand she appeared to accommodate christianity through historical analysis of the bible by rejecting passages which were clearly patriarchal and sexist
 mark scheme question indicative content marks june guidance others might discuss conclusion that there is no and such a must be by the greater number of passages where women are abused exploited and marginalised by patriarchal societies
 feminist theologians it might be argued have pointed to the radical nature of the kingdom of god which has yet to be fully implemented
 in genesis god creates male and female to have distinct characteristics which after the fall are reinforced in the particular roles which each has to perform
 the traditional distinctions are reinforced by a philosophical view which is that the complementary relationship is to be seen the in the the distinctions augustine
 in the gnostic tradition god is androgynous being the or christ and mary magdalene represent the principle sufficient for complete salvation
 mark scheme question indicative content marks some might argue that one of the important insights of feminist theology is a rediscovery of the range of gendered language which has been used to describe god especially the trinity
 it attempts equality by adding women to men christ there is thereby defining gender almost exclusively in male terms

 william established norman control effectively including feudal government which helped to reinforce the centralisation of the state and began that involvement with continental lands which was to have such an effect on the development of english government
 william henry and henry in particular recognised the need to develop mechanisms to allow the country to function effectively in their absence in their continental possessions
 kings were responsible for choosing these great officials not only the chief justiciar but also the chancellor who rose to new heights with hubert walter

 some may argue that its development depended mainly on the of strong kingship enabled royal authority to be effective over the whole a common network of shire and hundred courts existed and the writ was in general use
 for example his use of local justiciars and general eyres and the redirecting of some cases from the honorial to the shire courts helped to develop a common enforcement of the law
 some candidates are likely to argue that the work of henry played a greater part than feudalism in the development of common law
 he had foundations on which to build but he provided much of the stimulus to the growth of common law and much of the machinery which made it effective
 in the absence of a formal written code of the customs of england law was made by judicial decision on the bench at westminster
 the treatise on the rules of the court glanvill which helped to standardise practice also dates from henry reign as does increased use of the jury another characteristic of common law
 moreover the assizes of clarendon and northampton helped to tighten up the criminal law so that there was less variation there too
 anselm certainly managed relations with henry effectively in the discussions which led to the compromise of bec by which bishops would do homage and the king relinquished the right to invest them with the ring and staff
 after this the investiture contest was no longer a cause of conflict in england and anselm enjoyed good relations with henry
 even if candidates take a less critical view of role in the affair and point out lack of tact for example in having york crown young henry it would be difficult to conclude that becket managed relations well
 position was difficult from the beginning since john felt unable to accept an archbishop foisted on him but he was not comfortable with the political situation he found on his return to england
 they were particularly harmonious as they worked together for the establishment of effective norman rule and english church reform and ignored the summons to rome and thus contact with papal reform
 on the other hand some candidates may argue that as william and lanfranc apparently saw eye to eye on so many things little management of their relations was required
 question mark scheme answer issues were the main cause of rebellion in tudor how far do you agree with this candidates are expected to assess the extent to which rebellions in england were caused by social issues
 arbitrary entry fines and the revival of feudal taxes were complaints made against landlords in the and disturbances and underlay the tension between the gentry and commons
 the pilgrimage of grace western and rebellions offer good examples of social issues playing a prominent part in causing disorder on a large scale
 candidates could cite the as a period when poor harvests coupled with a trade depression and the introduction of new government taxes brought famine unemployment and poverty to many villages in the east and central counties of england
 pressure for work and demand for food when added to a shortage of fertile land placed the popular spotlight on enclosures although interestingly rebels never identified this factor as a source of discontent
 religious changes could be usefully assessed as they figured prominently in the pilgrimage of grace western and northern rebellions
 most candidates are likely to assess social and other factors in part to illustrate the complex nature of causation but also to demonstrate the importance of factors as a cause of rebellion
 some candidates may argue that weak organisation was an important the simnel warbeck western wyatt northern earls oxfordshire essex and most irish rebellions can be cited as evidence
 most rebellions and especially those in ireland were provincial in origin actuated by local grievances and the leaders had no desire to link up with other disaffected areas
 the government nearly always had better weapons more cavalry and financial resources more experienced soldiers and the knowledge that it was fighting on behalf of a divinely appointed monarch
 thus some rebel leaders such as warbeck aske kett arundel and northumberland avoided and when rival armies did meet as at stoke blackheath carlisle dussindale and clyst and naworth royal troops outnumbered and defeated the rebels
 royal armies in ireland defeated all uprisings apart from rebellions also failed because they did not usually engage the support of nobles and clergy
 the objectives were quite different from those of their social superiors and where gentry were involved as principal supporters in and fear of class betrayal and social disunity soon surfaced to weaken the rebellion
 candidates could also consider the role of government strategy which was to play for time and to offer pardons and promises if the rebels agreed to disperse
 once this occurred as in in lincolnshire and in devon divisions in rebel ranks appeared food supplies ran out and rebels began to desert
 question mark scheme answer warbeck wyatt northern earls essex munster and geraldine failed because they lacked foreign and native support to combat government troops and there was no substantial desire for regime change
 in england presented a greater threat to government ministers than to tudor how far do you agree with this criteria for would be helpful and may well appear in the better essays
 most candidates are likely to assess the seriousness of the threat posed by rebellions in respect of numbers of rebels location leadership objectives and how close each rebellion came to achieving its aims
 no tudor government was overthrown and it may be argued that however great a threat appeared at the time in reality the monarchs were not seriously threatened
 in spite of his numerous difficulties henry dealt effectively with the threats to his throne posed by yorkist claimants and faced no serious threat from the yorkshire and cornish tax revolts
 his ministers morton and bray survived calls for their resignation in henry in contrast the popularity and size of the amicable grant rebellion and was just as slow in dealing with the lincolnshire and pilgrimage of grace revolts
 limited resources and the reliance on nobles to suppress the threat as well as his own interventions made the threats more serious
 edward was never threatened by rebellion but his ministers somerset seriously misread the depth of feeling voiced by regional complainants in and failed to june mark guidance examiners must be open to alternative approaches
 mary was badly advised by her council about the nature and extent of threat and could not prevent the rebels from entering london
 as a result both she and her ministers were in danger in though in practice wyatt made critical mistakes which lessened his chances of success
 elizabeth in contrast acted decisively to weaken the threat presented by the northern conspiracy in their aim was to depose the queen and supplant william cecil and his court circle
 in mary stuart they had a legitimate heir to the throne but the rebels never advanced south of yorkshire mary remained a prisoner and cecil took measures to strengthen his authority
 in both elizabeth and robert cecil faced a potential danger but challenge to her throne and to cecil never gathered momentum due to measures taken by the privy council
 weak responses are likely to know little about government ministers and to assert rather than assess the nature of the threat presented by rebellions
 to what extent did continuity characterise the methods by which the tudors managed their foreign candidates can be expected to assess a range of methods used by the tudors in implementing their foreign policy
 methods such as political alliances and treaties marriage negotiations trade agreements and embargoes the threat and declaration of war the use of diplomacy ambassadors and overseas agents are likely to appear in many essays
 the means by which the tudors conducted their foreign affairs was flexible in that there was no methodological or diplomatic protocol that had to be followed
 change may therefore appear to be the main characteristic but most rulers were conservative in their behaviour and continuity of action underlay many policies
 for example most of the tudors preferred peaceful diplomacy to acts of aggression and candidates could usefully consider some of the more important political alliances trade treaties and matrimonial agreements to illustrate this feature
 political pressure was most effective when it was backed up with the threat of military action and preferably as part of a broader allied agreement
 henry for instance made alliances with spain and brittany before going to war with france and henry signed alliances with ferdinand and charles before launching attacks on scotland and france
 question mark scheme answer changed and relations became strained then diplomatic pressure could be applied through a variety of foreign ambassadors could be spoken to and english agents and envoys sent overseas
 like all early modern rulers the tudors saw the benefits of dynastic formal agreements shaped and consolidated the policies of henry henry and mary and negotiations were evident in and reign though they were less effective
 they took advice from a variety of people ambassadors envoys agents merchants councillors and ministers but dealt with and its enforcement personally
 they interviewed foreign ambassadors met crowned heads of state and in the case of henry and henry led their armies on military campaigns
 they negotiated the terms of political and trade treaties arranged matrimonial alliances for their relatives and exercised the sole right to declare war and peace
 like other european rulers they formed alliances not with permanence in mind but rather as a means to an end
 candidates should be able to find examples of both continuity and change across the tudor period and reach a judgement on their relative merits
 better responses should consider a range of weaker essays are likely to be less knowledgeable and more descriptive in tone
 it had many good harbours from which enemy fleets could set sail for eastern england just a few hours away
 henry defended his throne from burgundian backed yorkist pretenders and negotiated alliances with maximilian and philip candidates might point out that the decline of yorkist claimants and rise of charles altered relations
 indeed henry friendship with charles the absorption of burgundy into german empire in and later marriage to philip lessened its significance to england
 elizabeth adopted inconsistent tactics which reflected her shift in strategy towards spain although overall her policy stayed the to preserve security
 henry was keen to expand the woollen cloth trade and imposed embargoes on burgundian merchants in and for political and economic reasons events that demonstrate that when there was a conflict of interest trade yielded to political security
 henry took little interest in trade but the collapse of the antwerp market in had a most profound effect on relations
 as calvinism took hold of several dutch provinces and towns rebelled against catholic spain dutch leaders turned to protestant england for assistance
 at first elizabeth tried to stay neutral and urged other rulers to intervene before finally offering the rebels aid in the result was war with spain
 how far religious political and economic motives influenced her decision may be debated by candidates but tudor policy had clearly changed from one of neutrality to one of intervention and from amity to war
 the best candidates are likely to focus on the consistency of policy making towards burgundy and the netherlands and by inference account for any changes and inconsistencies
 if in doubt they should consult their question mark scheme answer in charles later pressurised the king not to divorce catherine but henry insisted
 each of the early tudors established key trade agreements with aragon and castile although england was not allowed to trade with the americas
 each formed important political alliances with spain which served to keep the countries at peace throughout the period the brief exception of but it may be argued that the military alliances benefited spain more than england
 for their part the tudors threatened boulogne in which was returned to france in the treaty of etaples and by henry in and retained at the treaty of ardres
 england under edward mary and elizabeth was at peace with spain until and each ruler managed spanish relations with a mixture of success and failure
 edward had few dealings with charles but irritated him by allowing a protestant reformation and making peace with france in but appeased him by ensuring mary was given freedom to practise her catholic faith
 philip had little affection for her did not enjoy living in england and resented his limited status as her consort
 expeditions in the and and her support for the rival portuguese claimant don antonio at a critical time in the candidates need to offer a balanced evaluation of the respective sets of rulers before reaching a judgement
 revival of the roman catholic church in the period from to owed little to the influence of how far do you agree with this candidates are likely to argue for and against the premise
 some will claim that the catholic revival began before the advent of protestantism and several elements of a revival occurred independently of june mark guidance team leader
 for example new orders such as the oratories ursulines barnabites theatines jesuits and discalced carmelites owed little to the protestant reformation although jesuit missionaries travelled to protestant countries to win back lost souls
 it may also be argued that key elements of the revival concerned a reformed papacy implementing the decrees of the council of trent and the work of jesuits all of which were more influential than protestantism
 it brought about a reform of clerical abuses and obliged the church to produce a clearer and less equivocal definition of doctrine at trent
 subsequently the catholic church attached greater importance to preaching and sermons were key traits of and to the role of the confessional and consistory reflection of the influence of which brought greater obedience and uniformity to the catholic church
 candidates do not have to be familiar with the theological beliefs of protestant reformers but they should offer a sound evaluation of the impact of protestantism
 balance between protestant and catholic reformation elements and influences is expected of better essays with specific focus given to in the premise
 the most likely reasons the jesuits unlike the regular orders did not live in common which enabled them to travel often internationally as papal agents
 they were also released by the pope from fasting wearing a clerical habit and the daily canonical routine which gave them greater independence
 the spiritual exercises disciplined both body and mind and was part of a year training programme that was far more rigorous than in other orders
 they were the only order to take a personal vow to the pope and as papal agents fulfilled diplomatic tasks e
 they embraced new ideas and technology such as the printing press and were excellent they could adapt to the slums of india and court life of vienna
 the quality of jesuit education was widely admired and their influence in seminaries schools colleges and universities had a lasting effect on the catholic reformation
 schools were founded in european cities by the quality of their education appealed to wealthy patrons and secular rulers who appointed them as confessors and tutors to their sons e
 although they were not originally founded to combat protestantism the jesuits became the catholic principal weapon and achieved outstanding results in southern central and eastern germany and particularly in june mark guidance examiners must be open to alternative approaches
 mark guidance contributed more than any other pope to the development of the catholic church in the period from to how far do you agree with this examiners must be open to alternative approaches
 this question requires candidates to compare the work of sixtus with other popes in the period before arriving at a judgement
 sixtus at was much younger than most popes and showed his energy and enthusiasm in several ways to transform the curia the catholic church and the city of rome
 reform of the curia was long he established or departments of state to administer papal affairs were concerned with temporal business including papal finances which were replenished and dealt with spiritual matters
 new roads and waterways opened a new vatican library erected an obelisk in st square and built a new dome on the cathedral itself
 he strongly supported the baroque style of architecture which led to a revival of religious art that soon spread to other european states
 candidates may judge sixtus to be more important than other popes and some may suggest paul deserves greater credit but a sustained comparison of sixtus and several popes across the period is needed for the top levels
 french nation state developed more in the period from to than in the period from to how far do you agree with this comparative assessment of the development of the french state before and after is required
 louis started to codify the laws kept taxes and expenditure low improved the administration of justice created new parlements and was a popular ruler in spite of an unsuccessful foreign policy
 royal finances were pronounced bankrupt in which made the crown vulnerable to the nobility and estates in the future and there was a steady growth in calvinism which weakened the unity of the state
 henry also lacked interest in administration and much resentment developed as a result of his dealing with the paris parlement nobles and provincial estates
 by many nobles hitherto fighting in italy had lost their raison être and were ready to turn instead to domestic violence
 candidates are likely to suggest that the death of henry and succession of a series of weak rulers from was a key reason for problems emerging in the development of the state
 thus the rivalry between the montmorency bourbon and guise families surfaced after in the absence of a strong monarchy and civil wars from june mark guidance examiners must be open to alternative approaches
 developments in government finances trade commerce industry transport and agriculture were all severely affected by the wars and any recovery after was consequently slow and erratic
 in contrast henry could be considered to have done most of all to further the nation state and his reign could be used as a counter argument
 he began the rehabilitation of the country domestically religious and social divisions restoring the political authority and together with sully laying sound economic and he strengthened the international standing
 candidates need to cover henry reign to achieve an effective synthesis as the years from to stand comparison with any in the earlier period
 some candidates may comment on the continuity of the politique mentality which helped henry restore and develop the nation state after the wars of religion
 mark guidance growth in the power of the french monarchy was hindered mainly by the poor condition of its how far do you agree with this view of the period from to examiners must be open to alternative approaches
 candidates should consider the nature and condition of french royal finances in this period to decide how far they the monarchy
 as a consequence french kings had limited finances with which to reward their subjects and distribute patronage and some nobles were wealthier than the crown which lessened the respect and loyalty felt towards the monarchy
 france was invaded on numerous occasions and the lengthy civil wars were in large part a result of the weak financial condition
 from to the crown could only afford to pay an army for two months at a time and control of much of the country fell to the nobility and local estates
 indeed in the first half of the period louis and francis had enough money to wage war and to keep the nobility in check
 indeed it was the strength of the royal finances after that enabled him to restore domestic and foreign peace and enhance the authority of the crown
 francis never tolerated heresy and after the day of the placards in he supported the parlements in a drive to suppress huguenots
 the concordat of bologna a compromise over the issue of the royal regale satisfied most groups though the sorbonne and paris parlement had reservations
 question mark scheme answer pleased with opposition to the calling of a general and when it did meet he refused to send any delegates
 francis did little to reform the french church of its endemic abuses and apart from the work of bishops such as meaux it remained corrupt and materialistic
 henry relations with the papacy he refused to send delegates to trent and in the gallican crisis of threatened to call a french council
 relations with paul from were more cordial but the hard stance through his use of the chambre ardente towards the huguenots led to a growth in calvinism among french nobles and an increase in tension between catholics and protestants
 royal officials especially intendants grew in number and threatened the influence of élus were appointed to some of the pays all june mark guidance examiners must be open to alternative approaches
 question mark scheme answer but one governor was replaced with more loyal noblesses de robe uncooperative clergy were dismissed the army grew from to and no estates general ever met
 counter argument is that richelieu was not that successful and that during louis minority in the the limitations of royal absolutism a legacy of richelieu became all too apparent
 nobles revealed their political ambition parlements anxious to protect the estates and their own privileges obstructed royal policies and crown officiers wavered in their loyalty to the government
 after mazarin increased the role of intendants took the army away from nobles like condé and turenne private retainers were clearly an obstacle to the development of an absolute and placed all troops under royal control
 some candidates might argue that royal absolutism was an unattainable goal in no minister succeeded in effectively curtailing the authority of provincial governors regional estates and the parlements all of whom obstructed royal edicts
 towns and cities like marseilles protected their chartered customs and privileges and seigneurial and church courts impeded the establishment of a uniform legal system
 exactly how policies of ministers helped or hindered the development of absolute monarchy will be the key to a good references to the contributions will also be relevant if they are tied to particular ministers
 as a result royal revenue increased but the tax and administrative system remained largely unchanged and lengthy wars ensured expenditure spiralled out of control
 louis governments had limited success in keeping finances in advisers like bullion and bouthillier sold offices debased the currency and levied new indirect taxes in an attempt to find new sources of revenue
 richelieu introduced élus to the pays and intendants oversaw tax assessment and collection encouraged overseas trade established a royal navy and improved domestic canal and road transport but was largely unsuccessful e
 in the he cut court expenditure abolished sinecures lowered interest rates amalgamated tax farming into one company reclaimed royal lands and increased the taille
 he regulated industries revitalised old ones founded trading companies established colonies in canada and the west indies and expanded the royal navy maritime fleet arsenals and naval stores
 after death in the french government lost control of royal finances debts mounted and schemes such as the development of overseas trading companies and colonies collapsed
 tax collection became less rigorous new taxes the capitation and fell on the impoverished classes the currency was debased and venality multiplied
 by the fiscal system remained unreformed the government had a debt in excess of million livres and the economy had been eclipsed by rival states such as england and the united provinces
 this treaty was the culmination of years of fighting and climaxed french dominance in europe over spain its longstanding rival
 it was now able to compete with the dutch and english for overseas trade and commerce seize more spanish territories and intervene in german politics over the next thirty years
 some might argue that the truce of ratisbon in was the major turning the emperor confirmed previous gains and possession of luxemburg strasburg and kehl
 some candidates might argue that events proved decisive such as the appointment of ministers mazarin and colbert in or the importance of louis majority rule and ambitious foreign policy

 this mark scheme includes any amendments made at standardisation events which all examiners participate in and is the scheme which was used by them in this examination
 the standardisation process ensures that the mark scheme covers the responses to questions and that every examiner understands and applies it in the same correct way
 as preparation for standardisation each examiner analyses a number of alternative answers not already covered by the mark scheme are discussed and legislated for
 if after the standardisation process examiners encounter unusual answers which have not been raised they are required to refer these to the principal examiner
 it must be stressed that a mark scheme is a working document in many cases further developed and expanded on the basis of reactions to a particular paper
 assumptions about future mark schemes on the basis of one document should be whilst the guiding principles of assessment remain constant details will change depending on the content of a particular examination paper
 verbal answers in english the basic principle of assessment is that candidates should gain credit for what they know understand and can do
 however these aspects are an integral part of assessing communication and marks cannot be awarded where errors in spelling punctuation or grammar lead to a failure to communicate the required information without ambiguity
 where a candidate has given alternatives or additional information in answer the following criteria should be if the does not contradict the key idea or make it ambiguous if the contradicts the key idea or makes it ambiguous reject
 where numbered lines are given within a of a question credit should be given for correct answers no matter which line they appear on
 where a question has more than one section a candidate may include as part of the answer to one section the information required to answer another section
 in questions where candidates are asked to name for example three types of vegetable sold in the market only the first three items they write down should be considered
 if the rubric instructs them to write one letter or number in the box and they do so but write a second letter or number outside the box too then the answer in the box should be considered
 tout court where a candidate has crossed out an answer and what was underneath remains legible then it should be assessed
 where a candidate spells the answer in such a way that it is a word in the target language no credit can be awarded
 if a candidate offers two different responses in english or in the target language eg dog or dog where the answer is dog no credit can be awarded

 examiners should also be prepared to award zero marks if the response is not worthy of credit according to the mark scheme
 where some judgement is required mark schemes will provide the principles by which marks will be awarded and exemplification may be limited
 when examiners are in doubt regarding the application of the mark scheme to a response the team leader must be consulted
 history marking guidance marking of levels of response the mark scheme provides an indication of the sorts of answer that might be found at different levels
 it is intended as a guide and it will be necessary therefore for examiners to use their professional judgement in deciding both at which level a question has been answered and how effectively points have been sustained
 candidates should always be rewarded according to the quality of thought expressed in their answer and not solely according to the amount of knowledge conveyed
 however candidates with only a superficial knowledge will be unable to develop or sustain points sufficiently to move to higher levels
 at the end of each answer examiners should look back on the answer as a whole in the light of these general criteria in order to ensure that the total mark reflects their overall impression of the worth
 deciding on the mark point within a level the first stage is to decide the overall level and then whether the work represents high mid or low performance within the level
 one stronger passage at level would not by itself merit a level award but it would be evidence to support a high level award unless there were also substantial weaknesses in other areas
 assessing quality of written communication qowc will have a bearing if the qowc is inconsistent with the communication descriptor for the level in which the answer falls
 if for example a history response displays mid level criteria but fits the level qowc descriptors it will require a move down within the level
 generic level descriptors section and the essay questions in part will have an analytical focus requiring candidates to reach a substantiated judgement on a historical issue or problem
 the statements will be supported by factual material which has some accuracy and relevance although not directed at the focus of the question
 low level marks the qualities of level are displayed but material is less convincing in its and the quality of written communication does not conform
 mid level marks the qualities of level are displayed but material is less convincing in its or the quality of written communication does not conform

 low level marks the qualities of level are displayed but material is less convincing its and the quality of written communication does not conform
 mid level marks the qualities of level are displayed but material is less convincing in its or the quality of written communication does not conform
 thus most candidates whose historical understanding related to a given question suggests that they should sit in a particular level will express that understanding in ways which broadly conform to the communication descriptor appropriate to that level
 indicators of written communication are best considered normatively and may be used to help decide a specific mark to be awarded within a level
 quality of written communication which fails to conform to the descriptor for the level will depress the award of marks by a within the level

 why might buddhists believe humans are more important than in the view of some buddhists animals are slightly lower in the order of sentient beings non human animals can not improve their karmic status and are therefore inferior
 this bad karma and the inability to do much to improve it led buddhists in the past to think that animals were inferior to human beings
 many buddhists believe that ecological problems are caused by selfishness and greed leading to much suffering of people and the world of nature as a whole
 they have compassion for all sentient beings which means that the preservation of a good environment for creatures is very important

 by living simply one can be in harmony with other creatures and learn to appreciate the interconnectedness of all lives
 candidates might consider some of the from a buddhists point of view the selfishness of humans lies at the root of the misuse of the environment which threatens to end in disaster for all living things

 candidates might consider some of the buddhists may differ in their view because they may reject war as it goes against the first percept ahimsa non harming
 many buddhists consider violence to be the cause of negative consequences and it contradicts the requirements of the eightfold path which entail treating others with compassion
 other buddhists might be prepared to go to war if an overall reduction in suffering is served by engaging in conflict
 many also accept that buddhist nations will need an army for defence which might lead to participation in a war
 there are no specific teachings in buddhism about war so it comes down to deciding what is the most on skilful action in any situation
 the five precepts and buddhists compassion for all sentient beings drives them to consider the needs and therefore rights of others
 however there have been many examples of religions being slow to defend human rights and on occasion they have been the supporters of oppression and the infringement of human rights
 some might argue that human rights which are based on humanistic values of the equality of all people are best defended without the help of religions

 the major focus is on the use of language especially how language is used to encourage applicants and on how the writers present information about their city

 they should not indulge in mere feature spotting and it is important to look for a sound organisation of the answers and of the linguistic points within them
 clearly there is some overlap and repetition of features but the notes have been set out in this way as most candidates will consider each text in turn
 these notes are by no means exhaustive and often only a few examples are given of a feature when there are many more in the text

 emphasis is placed on the vast number of students present in the city on the multiculturalism and its relative cheapness while referring repeatedly to the variety of entertainment options available
 it encourages applicants to imagine themselves living in leeds as students and the focus is clearly on the social aspects of student life

 inflation rate and unemployment rate of the countries south korea currently has the highest gross domestic product per head and it has a surplus on the current account of its balance of payments
 in its real increased by to and in it increased by a further the economy has the potential to grow at an even more rapid rate
 two of the reasons for this are that only a small proportion of women are in the labour force and that the country is experiencing a relatively rapid increase in its population
 one is an inflation rate which is significantly above its central target of some economists think that government spending should be cut to reduce inflationary pressure
 some economists suggest that the turkish government should use monetary and policy measures to tackle both of these concerns and move the to a new equilibrium
 using information in the case study identify evidence which suggests that the multiplier effect is likely to be different in turkey than in south korea
 discuss whether an economy will always benefit when the current account of the balance of payments moves from deficit to surplus

 section assessment grid marks in total total mark band band band band band articulate creative informed and relevant responses to literary texts using appropriate terminology and concepts and coherent accurate written expression
 marks summer guidance both sections of this paper require candidates study and discuss in detail a core text make wider reference to a partner text
 in both cases examiners will expect detailed critical discussion of the core texts with comparative reference made to the partner texts
 there is no ideal proportion of time to be allocated to the partner text in the it is the quality of the connections that counts and their contribution to the cogency and relevance of the response
 the emphasis should be squarely upon the question addressed through detailed analysis of the core text with the unseen text used only for the purposes of illumination and comparative reference
 in order to score well essays will have to move beyond accounts of these matters and look closely at the poetic techniques which have been employed
 approaches could the ways chaucer presents the character including implicit male strengths and weakness demonstrated through the husbands other pilgrims and the knight in the tale
 feminine strength and dominance through the loathly lady in the tale but also the inherent need to please men criminal their might be seen as weakness
 there is likely to be much emphasis upon poems such as london the little black boy poison tree and the chimney sweeper poems as candidates consider strengths and weaknesses presented in poetry
 there might be a tendency to overdo here and we should expect to see close consideration of the ways blake has made his social and moral commentaries as well as of the social conditions which produced them
 lyrical ballads as a collection is focused very clearly upon examples of human heroism and moral strength contrasted by some of the worst examples of human vice cruelty and weakness
 candidates are likely to draw upon a very wide range of poems and once again we will need to be alert to essays which offer plenty of social history without showing how the poets have presented issues and characters
 in all cases we must take care not to descriptive accounts which spot only those essays which explore the ways meaning is made can score highly
 approaches could consideration of the balance of prologue and tale in discussion of the verse form and the way it contributes to the character of the wife and the effectiveness of her speaking voice
 discomfort might include the ways poetry challenges our error or complacency or beliefs forcing us to acknowledge truths which are not necessarily palatable
 in order to address the task fully candidates will need to show how such experience is an essential feature of engaged reading the pleasure of which might be seen as a compensation for the discomfort endured
 others might discuss the pain or discomfort of empathising with exploited victims and could see this from the point of view of either gender
 there might be claims about the painful efforts needed to engage with middle english and the discomforts of coming to terms with different values and cultures
 popular approach to donne could revolve around the uncomfortable but rewarding efforts involved in following the complexity of with due consideration of metaphysical conceits and other poetic devices
 some might see the laying bare of romantic love and religious faith as involving an uncomfortable confrontation of the own doubts and insecurities
 candidates could embark on some interesting discussions of the contrasts between content and form in the songs and how this makes the experience of reading them both painful and pleasurable
 exactly the same points as those above for blake will apply to lyrical ballads but candidates might find some additional dimensions in the milder discomfort of in poems such as we are seven or expostulation and reply
 overview some might extend religion to include religious figures the friar and the pardoner in the prologue and and this is quite legitimate
 responses might range widely across religion and other aspects of the supernatural or they could make a distinction and focus more tightly on one or the other
 there is a great deal of potential material and we must beware of lists of examples without sufficient discussion of the poetic techniques involved in the presentation of these elements
 approaches could the supernatural dimensions of the tale magic fairy land etc and the interesting connection with religion mentioned at the very start of her tale
 there is likely to be consideration of the way religious doctrine is used and abused by the wife in her prologue for her own ends and by the loathly lady during the curtain lecture
 devotional poetry provides rich opportunities but we might also see the discussion extended to souls angels platonic forms and apparitions
 we will need to beware of too much contextual writing around the matter of conversion to protestantism but some who have researched the matter might be able to make good use of contextual references to sermons
 satirical treatment of religion priests and churches plus angels and animals embodying religious or supernatural power should provide plenty of material
 as always there is the danger of contextual issues from swedenborg to century church corruption overwhelming essays and we will need to see how blake has used religion and the supernatural to creative effects and meaning in his poetry
 pantheism hints of the supernatural in relationships and divine retribution combined with exploration of sin and redemption all provide excellent opportunities
 once again the literary qualities of the works must be to the fore rather than extensive considerations of romantic approaches to theology which might be relevant but only in carefully measured doses
 alternatively conflict could be seen as an internal struggle within the voice of the poem itself a quest for understanding insight or resolution of one kind or another
 approaches could the recognition of encroaching age but her desire to marry a sixth the different varieties of conflict with the first three husbands and the fourth and fifth husbands
 conflict between the wife and some of the male the conflict first with authority and then with his old wife who herself goes on to explore a range of conflicts within religious belief and social values
 my is a good example of the internal conflict suffered by the persona in all of the religious poems while the love poems and songs demonstrate a range of different sorts of conflict with different degrees of seriousness
 section total mark articulate creative informed and relevant responses to literary texts using appropriate terminology and concepts and coherent accurate written expression
 we should see a strong focus on lear himself kent cordelia edgar and the fool perhaps servant and as candidates explore the ideas
 we might also see some more subtle approaches to albany and possibly gloucester whose to scheming is born of fear and certainly concerns loyalty
 candidates should find plenty of material in oedipus linking to the bullying suspicious temperament the roles of tiresias and creon as well as the commentary of the chorus
 overview trickery manipulative adultery and on a grander scale the world which has deceived lear through flattery into believing himself are all likely to feature in essays
 and the tragedy exists in every scene and at every it is the single driving force of the in the light of this remark explore some of the ways shakespeare presents conflict in hamlet
 how far does presentation of hamlet inspire sympathy in an in the course of your discussion make comparative reference to presentation of vindice in the tragedy
 overview bereaved frustrated cheated heir to the reluctant aimless frustrated or faithless conspired against but also a casual graveyard indecisive and but also ready to excuse his own inaction
 by contrast vindice is decisive but brave and direct but pompous and foolish but apparently with right on his side until a lust for blood and lack of judgement overcome him
 there is an enormous amount of material for candidates to control so careful building a coherent balanced case with support and focusing on techniques will be the keys to success
 overview it is possible that responses might begin with or include a discussion of the motives in handing power to angelo and his claims that correction of morals in vienna at his hands would seem oppressive
 candidates might develop their arguments along abstract lines as they consider presentation of the oppressive nature of law and incursions into private lives
 the presentation of punishment in the courts and jails of the personal oppression of isabella and perhaps some subtle points about the shaping of events at the conclusion might feature
 the oppressive nature of church and the treatment of bosola antonio and the duchess as well as the examples of oppression and murderous tyranny over minor characters should provide plenty of opportunities for links to the duchess of malfi
 disease and decay should link well to the obvious imagery in the duchess of malfi plum trees by stagnant faces resembling and the dereliction in court and church life should not be hard to spot
 however other approaches might consider ambitions for marriage and for the political unification of milan and ambition to be free and ambition to regain his island
 primary concern in this play appears to be the delivery of a series of sharp moral in light of this remark examine presentation of moral issues in the tempest with comparative reference to doctor faustus
 overview the opening of the play with pity and compassion pitched against apparently severe treatment of the vessel and its crew introduces a moral debate about mercy punishment and justice
 this develops and continues throughout the play with every one of the characters not experiencing some form of correction retribution or instruction at the hands of prospero or his agents
 connections to faustus and his overreaching attitudes towards forgiveness and salvation and misuse of power should not be too hard to find
 comparative materials might the emptiness of illicit ambition power amounts to relatively little the intractable malice of satan and his crew the trivial nature of through the example of the clowns the value of nature of mercy
 the motives of the conspirators in edward ll the role of the queen herself and the presentation of the lords set against weakness arrogance and lack of responsible leadership should provide plenty of material for comparative reference
 as always we must beware of those responses which treat the plays as history and make little of the dramatic techniques involved
 how richard is shown to betray his nobles and his own country and how he is betrayed by those who should be his loyal subjects
 betrayals amongst the other characters might also be considered and how issues such as that between mowbray and bolingbroke at the start of the play are central to the themes and dramatic structure
 connections to edward could be plentiful with arguments conducted along the same lines as those suggested for the core text

 public and private sector investment in roads in britain over the past years there has been considerable growth in the road network in britain as shown in fig
 during this time the vast majority of roads have been built and maintained by the public sector with only a tiny number of private sector road projects being undertaken such as the toll road
 this suggestion has led to much debate about whether the public or the private sector should finance this vital part of the infrastructure
 open in early the prime minister david cameron gave a speech encouraging scale private to upgrade the road and motorway network
 whilst transport network is relatively good congestion is a daily problem in some places and maintenance work is needed elsewhere to upgrade roads in order to improve their use
 chosen well investment to address the problem of where traffic congestion is very is one of the most types of transport spending there is in britain as sir rod eddington noted in his report
 some economists note that although improving roads is neither exciting nor glamorous analysis favours these schemes more highly than national projects such as high speed rail links
 in the coalition government clearly ruled out road pricing on existing roads although it has since said that it would consider tolls on new roads
 the bigger issue which the department of transport has now been asked to consider is whether roads can be leased to private companies to encourage investment in them
 in such cases motorists would still not directly pay for using the roads but private companies would receive a payment from central government according to the number of drivers using the road
 these payments would be funded from the annual billion revenue from vehicle excise duty such a proposal would be a huge change in road funding in britain
 it would raise the debate about whether or not the principle of hypothecation of tax revenue should be applied to transport in britain
 turn over explain one difference between the approaches of the public and private sectors to decision making about major infrastructure investment projects
 discuss whether the government should raise indirect taxes such as air passenger duty on air travel in order to increase sustainability

 mark schemes are prepared by the principal examiner and considered together with the relevant questions by a panel of subject teachers
 this mark scheme includes any amendments made at standardisation events which all examiners participate in and is the scheme which was used by them in this examination
 the standardisation process ensures that the mark scheme covers the responses to questions and that every examiner understands and applies it in the same correct way
 as preparation for standardisation each examiner analyses a number of alternative answers not already covered by the mark scheme are discussed and legislated for
 if after the standardisation process examiners encounter unusual answers which have not been raised they are required to refer these to the principal examiner
 it must be stressed that a mark scheme is a working document in many cases further developed and expanded on the basis of reactions to a particular paper
 assumptions about future mark schemes on the basis of one document should be whilst the guiding principles of assessment remain constant details will change depending on the content of a particular examination paper
 verbal answers the basic principle of assessment is that candidates should gain credit for what they know understand and can do
 however these aspects are an integral part of assessing communication and marks cannot be awarded where errors in spelling punctuation or grammar lead to a failure to communicate the required information without ambiguity
 where numbered lines are given within a of a question credit should be given for correct answers no matter which line they appear on
 where a question has more than one section a candidate may include as part of the answer to one section the information required to answer another section
 in questions where candidates are asked to name for example three types of vegetable sold in the market only the first three items they write down should be considered
 if the rubric instructs them to write one letter or number in the box and they do so but write a second letter or number outside the box too then the answer in the box should be considered
 tout court mark scheme january series where a candidate has crossed out an answer and what was underneath remains legible then it should be assessed

 many believe the individual atman to be a part of brahman and to be ultimately reunited with it after moksha as all water flows eventually to the sea
 many see the belief that we are separate from brahman as illusion to be overcome through meditation and religious practice
 different branches of hinduism conceive of different individual deities as being effectively identical with brahman or and in these ways hinduism may envisage the divine as one and examiners should mark according to the descriptors
 it could be argued that ahimsa is so closely bound up with the idea of hinduism that it is crucial for all hindus
 candidates might use the example of gandhi who put ahimsa into practice in all areas of his life and made it a pivotal point of his teaching and philosophy
 candidates might also discuss issues such as vegetarianism and careers which do not cause harm as ways in which hindus can and should put ahimsa into practice in their lives
 raja dharma requires kings and rulers to govern efficiently and this may not always be in line with the principles of ahimsa
 some candidates might point out that ahimsa is only technically required of brahmins and that the wider application to all hindus is a much later development associated with other the life and example of gandhi
 others while acknowledging this might suggest that this is not an excuse not to try and that if everyone tried to live according to the principles of ahimsa the world would be a much better place
 spelling punctuation and grammar are assessed using the separate marking grid on page spag guidance question mark scheme answer june mark responses might dassehra mark for response
 responses might the new year the start of a new year the triumph of good over evil the return of rama and sita to ayodhya the defeat of the demon ravanna mark for each response
 in particular the story of holika is important as a reminder that good will always triumph over evil and that vishnu is loving and loyal and will protect his loyal followers as he protected prahlad
 also important is the reminder in the story that obedience and loyalty to god are more important than anything else including family ties and duty
 on the other hand the fact that india is so huge and that hinduism itself is so diverse can make it almost impossible for this to happen
 different stories and deities are important in different parts of india and even when the same festival is celebrated it may have a different central story and therefore different ways of celebrating
 candidates may however suggest that even where this is the case the central message of good overcoming evil remains unchanged and that it is this rather than particular customs or traditions which is the most important thing
 where hindus live outside india there may be reasons to do with why certain traditions are changed or adapted
 also the local hindu community might be drawn from a number of different parts of india with different stories and traditions
 for this reason it is not uncommon for new ways of celebrating to develop which can unite all hindus and which work well in a new country
 spelling punctuation and grammar are assessed using the separate marking grid on page spag guidance question mark scheme answer june mark shaktism guidance mark for response
 candidates would gain a mark for as he is an avatar of but would not then gain any extra marks for saying that for example is an avatar of as this is effectively the same belief
 shaivite sannyasins often live in cremation grounds and may cover themselves in ashes in an attempt to stop associating their true essence with the impermanent body
 the idea of a balance between male and female is also important to many shaivites and shiva is often depicted as a composite figure of shiva and his consort showing that the two cannot be separated
 shiva defies convention and expectation and his followers may feel called to defy the obvious in order to free their minds either by engaging in taboos in some forms of or through deep meditation
 candidates may explain about reform movements within hinduism such as the lingayats in southern india who reject physical representations of the divine in favour of a more philosophical spiritual and ethical understanding
 mark candidates might consider some of the candidates might suggest that many of the major festivals centre around goddesses in particular durgapuja and that this demonstrates the significance of the goddess in hinduism
 candidates might suggest that for shaktis the goddess is the divine absolute from which all else the emerges and that for this reason the goddess is the only truly important thing
 others might argue that the hindu culture which has traditionally given more freedom and status to men precludes this view
 the qualities which are applauded in goddesses and which women are expected to emulate are often submissive and maternal and do not encourage a real respect of the female either in society or in religion
 the rarity of female sannyasins they do supports this view as does book of the ramayana which describes the final state of sita
 candidates might also argue that goddesses and the image of the goddess are of growing significance in hinduism as a figurehead of feminist movements and as an empowering example for women

 they were both fired with the same zeal to keep a christian people in peace and each deferred to the advice
 in the meantime the english were groaning under the norman yoke and they suffered oppression from the proud lords who ignored the instructions
 the regents odo of bayeux and william fitz osbern were so swollen with pride that they were not prepared to listen to the pleas of the english however reasonable nor to give them impartial judgement

 the basis of this was that william should obtain possession of maine on behalf of duke robert and that robert should cede the castles he already held to william

 in the projections illustrate the uncertainty in the future no peak peak and decline plateau flat going these could be used as a structure for the answer i
 north sea oil peak in discovery of new oil reserves of conventional oil and or how much oil is actually left in existing reserves is disputed in some cases e
 use of enhanced recovery could delay peak oil lead to a plateau as more oil is physically this is partly related to technology in itself is an economic decision i
 economic decisions to extract oil from currently protected places could delay the peak might be seen as putting economic decision over environmental
 grammar punctuation and spelling errors are rare number question indicative content answers should focus on renewable accept nuclear and any other renewables including biomass
 answers could be structured by fossil fuel or by renewable sources potential to replace fossil coal mostly used to generated electricity and also in it is cheap and reliable baseload so would need a similar replacement
 numerous other renewables could be discussed such as wind solar tidal wave these all have pros and cons constraints reliability economic costs environmental details will depend on those chosen and the examples used
 replacements include electricity from renewable sources via electric vehicles new infrastructure needed short range at as well as biodiesel and bioethanol greener but issues of supply versus hydrogen could be discussed but there are cost safety and infrastructure concerns
 in many applications electricity from renewables is a possible alternative but biogas is also possible either from waste or biomass grown to produce biogas
 possibilities for assessment accept arguments that in reality alternatives such as shale gas or unconventional oil are more likely to replace current dependency on conventional fossil fuels for political and economic reasons
 some details in an account which outlines the advantages and disadvantages of a range of renewables in a descriptive answer with limited link to fossil fuels
 level question number some details of renewables and their advantages and disadvantages considered in relation to fossil fuels and has some implied assessment
 response which links fossil fuels to the renewables which might replace them and makes a judgment of how likely this is with detailed reference to pros and cons
 question indicative content answers should focus on physical reasons area has only renewable water per year area has per year some might comment that below per person an area faces water stress and below per person water scarcity i
 reducing annual rainfall making rainfall more unreliable increasing temperatures and thus has very low rainfall on mm year so the water inputs are low helping to explain the low water supply total
 thin soils and sparse vegetation mean interception is low and there will tend to be surface runoff rather than infiltration so reducing groundwater storage this is likely to be limited anyway by the impermeable bedrock
 better answers might argue more water could be got from the fossil groundwater aquifers but this is not renewable as it is not being recharged
 the vegetation forest encourages infiltration groundwater flow and the sandstone is permeable so will act as an aquifer pumps for do not credit human factors such as demand or actions such as creating urban areas etc
 as countries move from one development level to a higher one demand for water rises but also changes from agricultural demand to industrial and domestic demand

 the role of technology might be argued as helping to reduce demand by making water use such as water metering conservation schemes
 some might argue that priorities change over time as a result of development prioritising economic development towards water the possibility of balancing economic development and water conservation e
 detailed discussion of how water demand is influenced by economic development and environmental concerns balanced and covers several perspectives using relevant examples
 reasons for the pattern physical islandisation species on islands evolve in a different way the species of the original population and with a restricted gene pool this produces unique species
 altitude in mountain areas the altitudinal range produces a number of ecological niches vertical zonation in a very small area with unique species living at different levels in different climates microclimates
 climate limiting factors generally equatorial climates have high levels of endemism which is strongly linked to general levels of biodiversity because heat light and water availability influence growth
 coastlines on fig often have higher levels than interiors which might be explaining by the diversity of habitats where land and sea meet
 level of high endemism and biodiversity levels are often cited as reasons to protect areas which helps maintain it
 description is not required but is likely to appear as part of an highest levels are found in island clusters e
 mountain areas are also high ethiopian tropical areas have moderate levels central as do areas with mediterranean climates coast the mediterranean with levels falling towards the poles
 detailed and balanced explanation of a range of both physical and human factors with reference to different categories on figure structure is good
 grammar punctuation and spelling errors are rare number question indicative content answers could deal with value simply by outlining the value using the key words from the question or take a and approach

 examiners should also be prepared to award zero marks if the response is not worthy of credit according to the mark scheme
 where some judgement is required mark schemes will provide the principles by which marks will be awarded and exemplification may be limited
 when examiners are in doubt regarding the application of the mark scheme to a response the team leader must be consulted
 history marking guidance marking of levels of response the mark scheme provides an indication of the sorts of answer that might be found at different levels
 it is intended as a guide and it will be necessary therefore for examiners to use their professional judgement in deciding both at which level a question has been answered and how effectively points have been sustained
 candidates should always be rewarded according to the quality of thought expressed in their answer and not solely according to the amount of knowledge conveyed
 however candidates with only a superficial knowledge will be unable to develop or sustain points sufficiently to move to higher levels
 at the end of each answer examiners should look back on the answer as a whole in the light of these general criteria in order to ensure that the total mark reflects their overall impression of the worth
 deciding on the mark point within a level the first stage is to decide the overall level and then whether the work represents high mid or low performance within the level
 one stronger passage at level would not by itself merit a level award but it would be evidence to support a high level award unless there were also substantial weaknesses in other areas
 assessing quality of written communication qowc will have a bearing if the qowc is inconsistent with the communication descriptor for the level in which the answer falls
 if for example a history response displays mid level criteria but fits the level qowc descriptors it will require a move down within the level
 generic level descriptors part as part of an historical enquiry analyse and evaluate a range of appropriate source material with discrimination
 sources are used as evidence with some consideration of their attributes such as the nature origins purpose or audience with some consideration of how this can affect the weight given to the evidence
 in addressing there is a clear attempt to use the sources in combination but this may be imbalanced in terms of the issues addressed or in terms of the use of the sources
 the attributes of the source are taken into account in order to establish what weight the content they will bear in relation to the specific enquiry
 analyse and evaluate in relation to the historical context how aspects of the past have been interpreted and represented in different ways
 these will be supported by limited factual material which has some accuracy and relevance although not directed analytically at the focus of the the material will be mostly generalised
 they may however include material which is either descriptive and thus only implicitly relevant to the focus or which strays from that focus
 candidates offer an analytical response which relates well to the focus of the question and which shows some understanding of the key issues contained in it
 there will be some integration of contextual knowledge with material drawn from sources although this may not be sustained throughout the response
 the candidate will demonstrate the skills needed to produce convincing extended writing but there may be passages which lack clarity or coherence
 comprehends the sources and selects from them in order to identify points which support or differ from the representation contained in the question
 when supporting the decision made in relation to the question the sources will be used in the form of a summary of their information
 in addressing the specific enquiry there is clear awareness that a representation is under discussion and there is evidence of reasoning from the evidence of both sources although there may be some lack of balance
 assessment grid question number or total marks weighting and b marks marks marks total marks for question note on descriptors relating to communication each level descriptor above concludes with a statement about written communication
 thus most candidates whose historical understanding related to a given question suggests that they should sit in a particular level will express that understanding in ways which broadly conform to the communication descriptor appropriate to that level
 indicators of written communication are best considered normatively and may be used to help decide a specific mark to be awarded within a level
 quality of written communication which fails to conform to the descriptor for the level will depress the award of marks by a within the level
 on the surface the traditional representation of the of the provided by both sources and would seem to strongly disagree with the view presented in source and suggest that nightingale made significant contributions to helping the sick
 candidates may well suggest that the image published in the london illustrated news is a visual representation of the description offered by source and develop the ways in which these two sources support each other
 however although sources and offer direct opposition to source over the ways in which value as a nurse was perceived and hence her role in helping the sick the sources can be reconciled elsewhere
 some candidates are likely to link the claim made in source that nightingale enjoyed great influence at home with the widespread press coverage implied by the caption accompanying the drawing from the london illustrated news
 developed responses based on these arguments can reach at candidates will both support and challenge the stated claim using evidence from different sources interpreted in context
 at they will use the sources interpreted in context as a set to reach a reasoned judgement about the extent to which florence nightingale did help the in the crimean war
 number indicative content mark the question is focused on the impact of the boer war on public attitudes in britain towards the value of empire
 the evidence of source can be used in support of the contention in the question by highlighting mass support for the empire in the aftermath of the relief of mafeking
 candidates may well pick up on the final sentence of source outlining the role of the popular press in promoting imperialism to provide detail on the nature and growth of newspapers in this period
 source can be used to support further the view that enthusiasm for empire grew in the course of the conflict if commercial imperialism is used as an indicator
 candidates may well develop this on the basis of their contextual knowledge by referencing other ways in which popular enthusiasm for empire was being promoted in this period such as literature
 source clearly presents evidence for this although some candidates will recognise the significance of the provenance in their weighing of the argument
 nonetheless source in combination with the reference in source to opinion in favour of imperialist can be used as a platform for candidates to explore contemporary arguments surrounding the justness of the war
 some candidates may be able to develop the reference to hobson and his view of imperialism further on the basis of their contextual knowledge
 candidates who go on to consider whether or not the enthusiasm was maintained in the period should be credited appropriately
 the best responses may very well consider the interaction of different factors to explain the apparent conflict and offer an overall judgement
 number indicative content mark the question is focused on whether or not government control of the home front was effective during the first world war
 some candidates may well supplement the information given in the source with a range of other measures introduced by the government to tackle drunkenness such as restricting the sale of spirits and reducing licensing hours
 candidates may use this as a platform to explore state control in other aspects of everyday life such as the gradual imposition of rationing
 from their own knowledge candidates should be able to test this theory and explore further for example the munitions of war act of and how successfully it was applied to the regulation of wartime industry generally
 some candidates will extend this to an examination of increased government powers in the control of other industries such as shipping railways and agriculture
 alternatively some may contend as noted in the memorandum in source that the country continued to be plagued by strikes throughout the war
 the best responses may very well consider the interaction of different factors to explain the apparent conflict and offer an overall judgement
 britain the changing position of women and the suffrage question question number indicative content mark all three sources can be used both to support and challenge the contention in the question
 source stresses that the new colleges were not meant to challenge the existing status quo and candidates can point to the list of female roles which are identified within the source as further support for this claim
 some candidates may argue from these points that the very fact that the authors of all three of the sources felt it necessary to make such reassuring noises highlights just how gradual and change was meant to be
 alternatively candidates may contend that the breadth of the curriculum in source and the insistence that women need not be confined wholly to domestic in source do present something of a challenge to the philosophy of separate spheres
 developed responses based on these arguments can reach at candidates will both support and challenge the stated claim using evidence from different sources interpreted in context
 at they will use the sources interpreted in context as a set to reach a reasoned judgement about whether the changes in female education in the second half of the nineteenth century challenged the belief in separate spheres
 number indicative content mark the question is focused on the reactions of the labour and liberal parties to the issue of involvement in public life
 it implies that the imperatives of party politics were responsible for the approach taken by both the liberal and labour parties
 candidates can support this line of argument by reference to source in which the liberal leader can be seen to be opposing extending the vote to women
 from their own knowledge candidates should be able to further develop this viewpoint by examining the reactions to and attitudes of the liberal and labour parties to the issue of involvement in public life
 for the liberals hostility to suffrage the failure to support the conciliation bills and the negative impact of militancy are all likely to feature
 the best responses may very well consider the interaction of different factors to explain the apparent conflict and offer an overall judgement
 number indicative content mark the question is focused on the importance of the first world war in securing the vote for women
 many may argue that inequalities in pay dilution and the fact that women were all reinforced rather than dismantled the separate spheres philosophy
 evidence to buttress this view is presented by declaration of support in source some candidates will however weigh this evidence in the light of the provenance and their contextual knowledge
 thus some may argue that this shows a genuine change of heart in someone who had at best been lukewarm in his approach to female suffrage while others may see little more than empty political rhetoric
 the cessation of militancy for the duration of the war the replacement of asquith by the lloyd george as prime minister and the impact of coalition politics are all likely to feature
 the best responses may very well consider the interaction of different factors to explain the apparent conflict and offer an overall judgement

 examiners should also be prepared to award zero marks if the response is not worthy of credit according to the mark scheme
 where some judgement is required mark schemes will provide the principles by which marks will be awarded and exemplification may be limited
 when examiners are in doubt regarding the application of the mark scheme to a response the team leader must be consulted
 history marking guidance marking of levels of response the mark scheme provides an indication of the sorts of answer that might be found at different levels
 it is intended as a guide and it will be necessary therefore for examiners to use their professional judgement in deciding both at which level a question has been answered and how effectively points have been sustained
 candidates should always be rewarded according to the quality of thought expressed in their answer and not solely according to the amount of knowledge conveyed
 however candidates with only a superficial knowledge will be unable to develop or sustain points sufficiently to move to higher levels
 at the end of each answer examiners should look back on the answer as a whole in the light of these general criteria in order to ensure that the total mark reflects their overall impression of the worth
 deciding on the mark point within a level the first stage is to decide the overall level and then whether the work represents high mid or low performance within the level
 one stronger passage at level would not by itself merit a level award but it would be evidence to support a high level award unless there were also substantial weaknesses in other areas
 assessing quality of written communication qowc will have a bearing if the qowc is inconsistent with the communication descriptor for the level in which the answer falls
 if for example a history response displays mid level criteria but fits the level qowc descriptors it will require a move down within the level
 generic level descriptors part as part of an historical enquiry analyse and evaluate a range of appropriate source material with discrimination
 sources are used as evidence with some consideration of their attributes such as the nature origins purpose or audience with some consideration of how this can affect the weight given to the evidence
 in addressing there is a clear attempt to use the sources in combination but this may be imbalanced in terms of the issues addressed or in terms of the use of the sources
 the attributes of the source are taken into account in order to establish what weight the content they will bear in relation to the specific enquiry
 analyse and evaluate in relation to the historical context how aspects of the past have been interpreted and represented in different ways
 these will be supported by limited factual material which has some accuracy and relevance although not directed analytically at the focus of the the material will be mostly generalised
 they may however include material which is either descriptive and thus only implicitly relevant to the focus or which strays from that focus
 candidates offer an analytical response which relates well to the focus of the question and which shows some understanding of the key issues contained in it
 there will be some integration of contextual knowledge with material drawn from sources although this may not be sustained throughout the response
 the candidate will demonstrate the skills needed to produce convincing extended writing but there may be passages which lack clarity or coherence
 comprehends the sources and selects from them in order to identify points which support or differ from the representation contained in the question
 when supporting the decision made in relation to the question the sources will be used in the form of a summary of their information
 in addressing the specific enquiry there is clear awareness that a representation is under discussion and there is evidence of reasoning from the evidence of both sources although there may be some lack of balance
 assessment grid question and b number marks or total marks weighting marks marks total marks for question note on descriptors relating to communication each level descriptor above concludes with a statement about written communication
 thus most candidates whose historical understanding related to a given question suggests that they should sit in a particular level will express that understanding in ways which broadly conform to the communication descriptor appropriate to that level
 indicators of written communication are best considered normatively and may be used to help decide a specific mark to be awarded within a level
 quality of written communication which fails to conform to the descriptor for the level will depress the award of marks by a within the level
 in that case quality of written communication will raise the mark by a britain and ireland question number indicative content mark the sources offer evidence to both support and challenge the claim in the question
 candidates are likely to begin by an examination of source as this offers the strongest support for the view that the british response to the easter rising was characterised by excessive force
 this does not see the men as but rather says that they were actually of and should therefore not have been summarily shot
 by linking the to germany money source suggests that this was a legitimate punishment especially in time of war rather than the use of excessive force
 the only overt criticism that source makes of the approach taken by the british government is that it did not make the reason for its actions the actions themselves are not subject to criticism
 overall though the view in source contrasts strongly to the view presented by the author of source sources and are clearly in agreement on one key issue
 candidates could develop this agreement in several different ways to discuss whether the british response did involve the use of excessive force or not
 the fact that healy was writing to his brother would suggest that his gratitude was genuine and this might affect the way that candidates approach their line of argument
 candidates are likely to consider the provenance of these sources within their line of argument and any sensible comments that elucidate the differing perspectives should be credited
 developed responses based on these arguments can reach at candidates will both support and challenge the stated claim using evidence from different sources interpreted in context
 at they will use the sources interpreted in context as a set to reach a reasoned judgement about whether the british authorities responded to the easter rising with excessive force
 candidates are likely to begin by considering some of the arguments to be found in source which supports the view in the question
 candidates need to weigh the importance of these achievements against his contribution before source and source can both be used to develop this part of the argument
 source suggests that contribution as a leading member of the land league was significant because it resulted in giving tenants they had long in the land act
 this view could be contrasted with source which also refers to work in this field but which sees it as less significant than his political contributions
 the best responses may very well consider the interaction of different factors to explain the apparent conflict and offer an overall judgement
 candidates are likely to begin by developing a number of the arguments contained in source from which the statement is drawn
 it states that the gaelic league this might be linked to statement in source that there was a possibility that the organisation ran the of encouraging national although this was not its aim
 this too links to source as it does state in the opening line that the was not necessarily an intended consequence
 candidates could build on their contextual own knowledge to examine a range of political activities that nationalists were engaged in during the latter part of the century and link these to the focus of the question
 candidates might use their own contextual knowledge to demonstrate how this organisation used its activities to achieve the and political that is referred to in the source
 candidates might also make use of broader contextual knowledge to show how the gaelic league contained many of those who would go on to be leading nationalists e
 source clearly challenges the view in the question as it states that the organisation aimed to be focusing only on the language
 support for this can be found in the words of hyde himself which are presented in source when he argues that the organisation is fundamentally above politics
 this in itself could be argued by candidates as evidence for it being political insofar as it aimed to unite both unionists and nationalists
 candidates might draw on broader contextual knowledge to discuss other elements of the cultural revival that are not directly referenced in the sources such as the development of the abbey theatre
 the best responses may very well consider the interaction of different factors to explain the apparent conflict and offer an overall judgement
 britain and the nationalist challenge in india question number indicative content mark the sources offer evidence to both support and challenge the claim in the question
 candidates are likely to begin by looking at source which is most in agreement with the view that poor political skills were a major problem
 candidates may comment that because this was written considerably later as memoirs that moraes is influenced by the events surrounding partition
 he states in the press statement where he will want to be presenting events positively that tried to act as an although he does acknowledge that he has not had much success in this
 source and source also both agree on the role played by another factor in influencing the outcome of the second round table conference namely the role played by congress
 in view of source generally critical view of gandhi and the it might be argued that there could be some truth in this view
 candidates are likely to consider the provenance of the sources within their line of argument and any sensible comments that elucidate the differing perspectives should be credited
 developed responses based on these arguments can reach at candidates will both support and challenge the stated claim using evidence from different sources interpreted in context
 at they will use the sources interpreted in context as a set to reach a reasoned judgement about whether the main reason for the failure of the second round table conference was poor political skills
 candidates may however question how extensive this pattern was as keir hardie only visited india for a short period
 by using contextual knowledge of the events of the early period such as developing the reference to the partition of bengal candidates can test the validity of source argument
 it makes it very clear that both repression and the british response to it had a clear impact on the development of indian nationalism
 candidates are likely to work source and source together and combine them with additional material based on contextual own knowledge to demonstrate how repression contributed to the growth of indian nationalism in the period
 candidates who consider other reasons for the development of nationalism on the basis of their contextual own knowledge should be rewarded accordingly
 the best responses may very well consider the interaction of different factors to explain the apparent conflict and offer an overall judgement
 candidates might begin by an examination of source the lahore declaration which some historians have argued laid out the basis for the future state of pakistan
 it is an ambiguous statement noted by source and candidates might use their contextual own knowledge to show that even muslims interpreted it in different ways
 from this perspective candidates might argue that it was the way in which jinnah manipulated the political system that was to lead to partition and that he was therefore responsible for it
 candidates could also use their own contextual knowledge to identify other aspects of approach which can be regarded in the same light e
 candidates might elaborate on this on the basis of their contextual own knowledge add additional detail of further examples of made by congress especially in the period after e
 there are a considerable number of valid routes through this question and all should be rewarded according to the quality of argument and supporting evidence derived from contextual knowledge
 the best responses may very well consider the interaction of different factors to explain the apparent conflict and offer an overall judgement

 aos total mark for each question level level recall select and deploy historical knowledge appropriately and communicate knowledge and understanding of history in a clear and effective manner
 it might be argued that popular grievance was more economic than political that extended poor relief did its job well but that the political challenge was never great
 candidates may also stress the relative importance of policies especially after suspension of habeas corpus the treasonable practices act extending the scope of treason the seditious meetings act and higher stamp duties to restrict press readership and radical ideas
 the impact of policies may be weighed against the weakness of the radical movement and candidates may note that the repressive measures were shrewdly temporary so that they could avoid the accusations that traditional liberties were being permanently suppressed
 there might be comment about use of the army as was needed pitt had no difficulty using parliament monarchy and the army to prevent a minority gaining popular support for its radical views but he did so expertly
 they may argue that the radical movement was defeated because it was weak as it was divided over aims and methods associated with france and lacked genuine popular support
 however although the threat was defeated or at least contained there were corresponding societies combinations riots and machine smashing
 no set answer is looked for but candidates will question mark scheme answer how far would you agree that tory governments were no more liberal from to than from to june marks guidance need to answer the question
 the question of how liberal the tories were in the period after remains an open one but most are likely to argue that they were more liberal after than before
 to support the view candidates could the appointment of younger politicians such as canning peel and huskinsson after the economic legislation passed by both robinson and huskinsson and the reforms of peel at the home office
 candidates are likely to argue that even if the later period was not that liberal the earlier period was repressive and point to the corn laws the suspension of habeas corpus the six acts and seditious meetings
 however this might be balanced against the need to tackle unrest and that the acts were no more repressive than there might also be some consideration of the more liberal reforms of the earlier period
 attempts to broaden the appeal of the party might also be discussed and candidates might be aware that the election results suggest he failed in this aspect and was returned to power on traditional tory votes
 there might be some discussion about the significance of the and also his support for some whig measures to argue that he had shown the party was responsible and fit to govern
 it is likely that many will consider his treatment of backbenchers once he was in power and his belief that it was his duty to serve the nation and monarch not the party
 many are likely to suggest that his action over the corn laws suggests he was a poor party no set answer is looked for but candidates will need to answer the question
 some might argue that it was not successes that brought the conservatives back into power but the mistakes and failings of the whigs
 the education act although it played an important role in providing education for working class children was an uneasy compromise between anglicans and nonconformists and it created class divisions
 trade union reform may have equalised the law between worker and employer but stopped short of what the skilled workers picketing and immunity from prosecution for strikes
 administrative reforms such as the civil service and universities may have brought equality of opportunity but there were still few who could take advantage of the changes
 question mark scheme answer how important were qualities in his emergence as conservative candidates might look to weigh up the strengths of disraeli as a leader against his weaknesses and other possible contenders before reaching a balanced conclusion
 in agreeing with the statement they might argue that derby had not been interested in leading the party and was more at home whilst other possible contenders such as gladstone had left the party
 this argument may be further developed by looking at the weaknesses of he was after all an outsider for the conservative party not an anglican
 however some might argue that he was their best speaker had managed to pilot the second reform act through parliament after failure and shown himself to have appeal
 it might be argued that his successful guidance of the reform act through parliament was what guaranteed him the succession
 candidates who wish to access the higher levels will need to consider the named factor even if they argue that it was not the most important
 some may argue that it was consistent with previous concern for the working class and use his novels and the second reform act to support this claim
 they may also examine the nature of some of the reforms to show how they elevated the condition of the working people and therefore must have been important
 some might argue that as with the second reform act his concern was to dish gladstone and the whigs and simply used the reforms for political advantage
 russia was an important factor and candidates might point to concern shown during the crimean war and in discussing the eastern question particularly this might be linked to events such as wars in afghanistan or developments concerning india
 this issue might also be linked to trade and the need to preserve trade routes particularly to india and how this impacted on relations with russia
 this might also be linked to imperial concerns over india and therefore the issue of the mediterranean and the suez canal might feature
 there might be some consideration of the importance of support for nationalist movements and relationship with italy germany and poland in this period might be considered
 question mark scheme answer policy of imperialism from to was consistently popular in how far do you the party that dominated politics in this period was the conservatives suggesting it was a popular policy
 candidates could support this with reference to the khaki election of where their victory an overall majority of was in part the result of patriotic fervour in the earlier part of the boer war
 there was questioning of imperial vision and the social and medical problems of recruitment brought demands for a concentration on domestic issues
 gladstone in turn was in trouble by over egypt and especially for his failure to send sufficient troops to save general gordon in his attempts to defend khartoum from the attacks by the mahdi
 some candidates might point to the celebrations after key events to suggest the policy was still popular although others may argue that these were more a sense of relief that relatives had survived
 whether the working class were responsive to imperialism was far from certain especially as the empire could be portrayed as wasteful when social reform was a more pressing issue
 assess the reasons why there was so much support in britain for the decision to go to war in june marks guidance no set answer is looked for but candidates will need to address the question set
 candidates might consider feeling and the reasons for this although examiners should be cautious of candidates who simply turn this into an essay on why relations with germany deteriorated
 there may be some who argue that there was a need to protect british interests such as the empire and this might be linked back to the perceived german threat
 candidates may also consider the importance of the formation of the first labour government as this established the labour party as the genuine alternative and gave them credibility
 the role of macdonald may also be considered as he succeeded clynes his qualities of leadership and his socialist philosophy which was of the organic evolutionary type
 trade unions were the most important reason for the general strike in how far do you candidates will need to address the role of the unions even if they conclude that other parties were more to blame
 the government were intransigent combined with an economic policy that was in part mistaken by returning to an overvalued currency backed by gold in as the main cause
 candidates might also point out that it was the government that precipitated a strike on may by calling off negotiations not the unions
 the case for union unrest as the main cause is the growing power and influence of the unions up to the first world war and their reaction to changed economic conditions after it
 previously they had been the aristocrats of the labour market and long unionised they were especially hard hit by economic contractions new fuels poor geological conditions and under investment in mining technology
 employers might also be blamed as they argued that a competitive price could be achieved only at the expense of the miners
 it might also be argued that having scored victories with the sankey commission and on red friday they were keen to make a stand on behalf of other well organised but struggling industries
 it might also be noted that the unions failed to see red friday as simply a government tactic to buy time and stockpile and prepare for a strike
 how important was role in election victory of at the higher levels answers will need to focus on the question of and not simply provide a list of reasons
 in order to reach level candidates will need to consider the role of attlee even if they conclude that he was not the most important reason and offer an alternative
 some might argue that he lacked charisma and popular appeal and was therefore not important whilst others might suggest that it was the popularity of labour and their commitment to reform that enabled attlee to win
 they were associated with social reform and appeared to promise a new start and an improvement in the lives and welfare of the people
 there were also many voters who turned to labour and they had a large influence as there had not been an election since added to this many returning servicemen supported labour
 it was difficult for britain to resist this unless they played the cold war card as they did in malaysia
 this could be seen as the main reason for decolonisation by the candidates may consider the pressure from colonial national movements such as the gold coast riots in and the mau mau in kenya
 this also had an economic impact that britain could not handle after the war and will provide candidates with opportunities to link together factors
 although there were many attempts to foster local elites and economies this strategy usually involved the acceptance of independence as a goal that tended to come sooner rather than later
 talk centred on managing decolonisation as part of trying to retain influence this was certainly the view of macmillan after racism at home may also be mentioned
 question mark scheme answer assess the reasons why attitude towards europe changed in the candidates are likely to consider a number of reasons
 candidates may consider the perception that britain had to make a choice between the empire and europe and with wind of shift to altered conservative views
 this might be linked to distrust of the schumann plan and there may also be consideration of the attitude of the french towards britain particularly de gaulle
 candidates might also point to the obvious success of the by particularly in terms of the economy and that this became important to britain
 it might also be noted that the economic success of the commonwealth could not be compared with the june marks guidance no set answer is looked for but candidates will need to answer the question
 question mark scheme answer how successful was thatcher as a world at the higher levels candidates will need to address the issue of as a and not simply list successes and failures
 candidates might consider issues such as the falklands and role in the ending of the cold war and role in the first gulf war over kuwait as evidence of her success as a world leader
 however others may argue that she played a minimal role in the ending of the cold war and go on to link this to subservient role to the noting issues such as grenada
 labour won in by the large swing in the popular vote but only by a narrow margin of to the conservatives and only a seat majority in the commons
 however many candidates will conclude that it was the conservatives who lost the election in the years after rather than labour or wilson who won it
 the industrial relations act was so broad in scope that it became a target for labour the good aspects were lost in the general bitterness about the method of its passage
 the ugandan crisis inflamed hostility towards immigration ireland was another problem as heath relied on the support of unionist mps
 however there were some taxes were cut radical reform of tax and benefits system was well advanced when the government fell and therefore candidates may argue that it was not a complete failure
 there was rising unemployment combined with the determination to speed the rate of growth before entry to the led to deliberate economic expansion which flew in the face of the previous commitment to solve the problem of inflation
 when considering the weakness of labour they might consider the weak leadership of foot and kinnock as major factors or they might look at areas of policy that were not popular with the electorate particularly defence
 labour were also closely associated with the trade unions and the question of too much union power following the of might be seen as an issue
 in the first period in office labour weakness was an issue as with the economic problems of rising unemployment it should have been possible for labour to have been a strong alternative
 some answers might suggest that thatcher had a strong set of ministers around her others might comment on the reforms particularly the denationalisation and selling of council homes which helped to create a new class to which thatcherism appealed

 this could be similar topics related to information in other countries or may be the same countries but in greater depth or on closely related topics
 it would be particularly useful to note if other case studies seem similar in nature or if they show contrasting perspectives to those from the material in this resource folder
 some of the resource materials come from geography textbooks but others come from companies pressure groups research organisations governments and private individuals
 it is worth considering if they are trying to support a particular interest group and persuade readers to agree with them
 in finding other materials it is worth bearing in mind that they might not be presented in an impartial and objective way
 such linkages are sometimes referred to as textbooks journals good quality newspapers and television and radio programmes are good sources of information
 probably the most accessible source of geographical information is the internet but it is also the one which may be most susceptible to bias and lack of impartiality
 many are only extracts or shortened versions of fuller documents and some may be inaccessible by the date of the release of this resource folder
 following some of these links for greater depth of reading and for more recent updates of material can be helpful but is not essential
 copies of the resource folder with added notes or notes from research carried out in the previous six weeks may not be taken into the examination

 mark scheme june annotations annotation meaning blank page this annotation must be used on all blank pages within an answer booklet or and on each page of an additional object where there is no candidate response
 mark scheme june marking instructions handling of unexpected answers if you are not sure how to apply the mark scheme to an answer you should contact your team leader
 at level candidates are required to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding and their ability to sustain a critical line of argument in greater depth and over a wider range of content than at level
 select and demonstrate clearly relevant knowledge and understanding through the use of evidence examples and correct language and terminology appropriate to the course of study
 in order to ensure the marking scheme can be and consistently and to examiners to mark in a standardised it defines levels of response by which answers are assessed
 this ensures that comparable standards are applied across the various units as well as within the team of examiners marking a particular unit
 in candidates answer a single question but are reminded by a rubric of the need to address both objectives in their answers
 in the marking scheme each question is provided with a brief outline of the likely content lines of argument of a answer but this is by no means prescriptive or exhaustive
 examiners must not attempt to reward answers according to the extent to which they match the structure of the outline or mention the points it contains
 the specification is designed to allow teachers to approach the content of modules in a variety of ways from any of a number of perspectives and answers must be assessed in the light of this flexibility of approach
 it is quite possible for an excellent and valid answer to contain knowledge and arguments which do not appear in the each answer must be assessed on its own merits according to the levels of response
 synoptic skills and the ability to make these are now assessed at as specification due to the removal of the connections papers
 question mark scheme indicative content marks candidates could assess the tensions between individual conscience and moral absolutes religious teaching or laws and consider whether conscience is vital when making moral decisions
 june guidance to what extent is conscience vital when making moral some answers may begin by defining the key term in the question i
 some candidates in discussing the vital use of conscience might consider whether it is reliable as a source of moral decision making
 they may say that using ethical theories such as utilitarianism are more important when making ethical decisions and give examples to illustrate this
 candidates could state that conscience is less or more vital than using an ethical theory in moral decision making
 alternatively they might argue that one view of conscience is more effective than others for example by contrasting the view of butler with that of freud
 candidates could look at the reliability of conscience and factors that undermine it for example a conscience formed by ignorance erroneous ideas parents or authority
 they may also assess the possibility that conscience could be used to justify any actions idea of apparent or that people when faced with a moral dilemma will use conscience to justify different courses of action
 question mark scheme indicative content marks candidates might explain utilitarianism perhaps in terms of bentham mill singer and the main types of utilitarianism e
 they may focus on one sexual issue or consider more than one in order to assess how useful utilitarianism may be when making decisions
 they may consider that utilitarians would weigh up the harm or pain the emotional harm that could caused and the pleasure gained from consensual sex
 candidates may consider the term as meaning how easy the system is to use in terms of practical moral decision making on sexual ethical questions for example quick reliable straight forward consistent in the responses given
 they are likely to examine various ethical theories in order to assess the usefulness of utilitarianism in contrast to different approaches to sexual ethics e
 candidates may say that it depends on what aspect of sexual ethics is being debated as to whether utilitarianism may offer any help for example they may compare the approach of utilitarianism to homosexuality and to extramarital affairs
 they may consider for whom utilitarianism might be useful the individuals concerned or society as a whole some might refer to harm principle in this context
 they may assess the usefulness of the various ethical theories when considering the rights and wrongs of utilitarianism as an approach to sexual ethics
 candidates could discuss what is meant by upbringing and social conditioning and whether it means we are not free to make ethical decisions
 they may consider the views of darrow and the court case of leopold and loeb he defended that depended upon genetic inheritance and upbringing
 they may consider the views of psychologists such as piaget and kohlberg who argue that it is our moral development linked to our and the society in which we live that leads us to make ethical decisions
 candidates may legitimately refer to any one or more of exemplar cases where upbringing and social conditioning have been used as a defence for criminal actions for example leopold and loeb mary bell the jamie bulger killing etc
 question mark scheme indicative content they could compare a determinist view with libertarianism and compatibilism and discuss whether we can make free ethical decisions
 june marks guidance some candidates might consider theological determinism such as teaching on predestination and religious teachings on free will
 candidates may consider the implications for ethics if our ethical decisions are all the result of our social conditioning and so are never really freely made
 candidates may legitimately interpret the analogy by john locke of the man in the locked room in a variety of ways so that he may be held as an example of both hard determinism and compatibilism
 they might consider whether we are free or just feel free and the idea that freedom is just apparent we may feel free but we are not
 some candidates may consider the implications of recent discoveries in cognitive neuroscience such as the veto effect or any other valid interpretations of the origins of free will such as memes etc
 they may introduce the teaching of to be moral we must be free and make decisions using our reason as determinism does not apply to acts of the will
 question mark scheme indicative content marks religious moral duties will depend upon the religious moral approach taken by the individual candidate for example biblical moral duties may originate in divine command theory or natural law theory or situation ethics
 they may even discuss the prosperity theology movement among the evangelical churches of the which sees personal wealth as a sign of favour and hard work by employees considered important to contribute to this
 however they may also explain the view of friedman that businesses exist to make a profit for their shareholders and to act in their best interests
 candidates must focus their response on the key term within the question of religious moral duty rather than other concepts of duty such as that expressed by kant within his ethical system
 reference to the summum bonnum within kantian ethics may be legitimate provided the candidate has specifically applied a religious understanding of the concept to business ethics and the moral duty of a business towards their employees
 question mark scheme indicative content they may use religious ethical theories such as natural law or situation ethics to decide who should take priority
 they may use examples to illustrate their answer such as companies that give their employees shares such as the john lewis partnership
 in assessing this question candidates may consider the different aspects of corporate responsibility such as that used by crane and matten assessing the different responsibilities to the different stakeholders
 they may argue employees want fair wages and good working conditions shareholders expect a good return on their investment and consumers want good products at reasonable prices
 candidates could assess the various merits of these stakeholders when deciding whether businesses should always put the needs of their employees first
 june marks guidance candidates may use prima facie duties to show how decisions can be made of ethical and they may discuss how these prima facie duties may even contradict one another and are not allinclusive
 some candidates may refer to the kantian concept of duty in comparison with religious ethical responses to the moral responsibility held by businesses towards their employees

 marking instructions assessment objectives grid question totals total mark scheme june candidates answer the one compulsory question in section and one question chosen from sections and assessment objectives and are addressed in both sections
 marks guidance content basic answers will be informed by a limited understanding of speech analysis and will often do little beyond summarise the passages
 key features of phonic importance which can be addressed links between speech and importance of importance and variety of vowel effects of examining spoken methodologies for achieving these aims
 these responses should support the analyses with a reasonable amount of relevant illustration drawing upon phonemic symbols or some methods which give clear illustrative exemplification
 levels of response level level level level level level mark scheme june section the language of popular written texts question answer the question anticipates candidates will apply a range of relevant linguistic terminology to their responses
 it is not necessary for candidates to compare passages nor treat each in equal depth though they may do so if they wish
 there are possible issues in terms of the passages using language which could be termed pointing out that numerous other productions are often constructed in what seems an exclusively masculine discourse
 june levels of response mark scheme june section language and cultural production question answer the question anticipates that candidates will apply a range of relevant linguistic terminology to their answers
 stronger answers will make efforts to engage with the quite complex cultural production generated by and through the of art
 passage introduces the passage both phrases should be helpful to candidates in assessing how far the linguistic structures signify a detailed engagement economic and aesthetic with the title of this section of the paper
 there might be further responses from their own experiences of consuming a factor which is now widespread through much popular culture such as music and television
 levels of response level level level level level level mark scheme june section language power and identity question answer the question anticipates that candidates will apply a range of relevant linguistic terminology to their answers
 there is a clear which is constructed via whole passage could be read as a hortatory warning about the subversion of our the concluding declarative sentence with the plural personal pronoun emphasises a conflict between ourselves and our identities
 candidates should have no problems in bringing in wider issues to their answers for example some analysis of why the chosen generic language would make such texts representative of power and identity

 the short term pain from cuts will prove to be of benefit in the long run as the reduction of the structural deficit now will facilitate a much stronger recovery
 arguments advanced against the premise of the question may cuts in public spending and increases in caused the economy to stagnate with sluggish growth
 coalition austerity has failed on its own terms of firstly halving the structural deficit by and secondly retaining the triple credit rating
 even if austerity is accepted in principle it was arguably far too with the cuts having a massive impact on services particularly hurting the most vulnerable
 contrasts may be drawn between the rise in living costs and pressures on wages for with the higher rate tax cuts and bonuses etc
 some argue that austerity is simply an for an ideologically driven attempt by the conservatives in particular to reduce the size of public sector

 it is contrary to democratic very few citizens understand how decisions are actually taken fuelling the concept of the as bureaucratic and unresponsive
 criticisms of the may it is centralised and run by officials who have little understanding of the situation on the ground and impose overly strict quotas
 it is unfair on the fishermen in certain areas who find their quotas to fishermen of other countries the impact of the factortame ruling and the decline of fishing in places like cornwall could be cited as evidence

 examiners should also be prepared to award zero marks if the response is not worthy of credit according to the mark scheme
 where some judgement is required mark schemes will provide the principles by which marks will be awarded and exemplification may be limited
 when examiners are in doubt regarding the application of the mark scheme to a response the team leader must be consulted
 history marking guidance marking of levels of response the mark scheme provides an indication of the sorts of answer that might be found at different levels
 it is intended as a guide and it will be necessary therefore for examiners to use their professional judgement in deciding both at which level a question has been answered and how effectively points have been sustained
 candidates should always be rewarded according to the quality of thought expressed in their answer and not solely according to the amount of knowledge conveyed
 however candidates with only a superficial knowledge will be unable to develop or sustain points sufficiently to move to higher levels
 at the end of each answer examiners should look back on the answer as a whole in the light of these general criteria in order to ensure that the total mark reflects their overall impression of the worth
 deciding on the mark point within a level the first stage is to decide the overall level and then whether the work represents high mid or low performance within the level
 one stronger passage at level would not by itself merit a level award but it would be evidence to support a high level award unless there were also substantial weaknesses in other areas

 level mark descriptor comprehends the surface features of sources and selects from them in order to identify points which support or differ from the view posed in the question
 when reaching a decision in relation to the question the sources will be used singly and in the form of a summary of their information
 when supporting judgements made in relation to the question relevant source content will be selected and summarised and relevant own knowledge of the issue will be added
 interprets the sources with confidence showing the ability to analyse some key points of the arguments offered and to reason from the evidence of the sources
 develops points of challenge and support for the stated claim from the provided source material and deploys material gained from relevant reading and knowledge of the issues under discussion
 focuses directly on the question when structuring the response although in addressing the specific enquiry there may be some lack of balance
 reaches a judgement in relation to the claim supported by information and argument from the sources and from own knowledge of the issues under debate
 interprets the sources with confidence showing the ability to understand the basis of the arguments offered by the authors and to relate these to wider knowledge of the issues under discussion
 presents an integrated response with developed reasoning and debating of the evidence in order to create judgements in relation to the stated claim although not all the issues will be fully developed
 interprets the sources with confidence and discrimination assimilating the arguments and displaying independence of thought in the ability to assess the presented views in the light of own knowledge and reading
 thus most candidates whose historical understanding related to a given question suggests that they should sit in a particular level will express that understanding in ways which broadly conform to the communication descriptor appropriate to that level

 candidates are likely to examine the dominance of edward seymour after the downfall of the howards and gardiner in and consider the extent to which as lord protector somerset worked in the interests of royal authority
 it can be argued that henry was increasingly open to manipulation and this produced dangerous rivalries in both court and government
 the ascent of a young boy enhanced this tendency but there was nothing new in having factional struggles and religious differences merely added a new dimension of bitterness
 number indicative content mark this question addresses the religious settlements of the reigns of edward and mary and asks candidates to assess why their success was limited
 nevertheless candidates may point to resistance to individual issues such as the removal of catholic altars in and the second act of uniformity in to consider the extent to which resistance was overcome within brief reign
 the duration of her reign and lack of an heir was undoubtedly significant in the ultimate cardinal reforms were not fully implemented by the time of death
 in many ways protestantism was established and there was a lack of sufficient finance to reverse the changes made under edward
 at level there will be clear argument and balanced coverage and candidates are likely to make clear critical distinctions between the two reigns possibly challenging the assumption that either settlement was not successful
 at level there will be a real debate with reference to both reigns and candidates should begin to explore the relationship between the different factors
 at level there may be some imbalances or less convincing focus on the reasons behind the limited success of the religious settlements
 revolution republic and england question number indicative content mark this question targets the period from to and asks candidates to assess the nature of this
 whilst candidates are not expected to offer knowledge of a whiggish view of charles many may be familiar with the contention in the question
 in arguing for the claim candidates may examine use of prerogative powers to raise funding with the use of such measures testing relations with the subjects being considered with reference to ship money and the hampden case in england
 the work of the privy council which met over times in the period the detached nature of court and reliance on a narrow set of advisers such as laud and wentworth may all be examined by candidates
 in countering the contention candidates may argue the work of the privy council and attempts to regulate the royal court as measures to bring greater efficiency to stuart government
 similarly whilst the length of the rule within parliament was unusual the frequency of parliaments in the by no means set a precedent charles was obliged to follow
 whilst candidates are not expected to draw on knowledge of this period candidates may reason from the experience of the period up to in considering actions
 candidates may draw from a range of financial political and religious themes in examining the question although for higher levels the focus should be firmly maintained
 at the lower levels expect a narrative of the events of these eleven years with minimal address to the issue of such as a description of royal policies over the period
 number indicative content mark this question is focused on the first civil war and asks candidates to assess the reasons for parliamentary victory in this
 whilst charles had the upper hand in he did not win a decisive victory during which time parliament was able to begin to overcome its own divisions and shortcomings
 council of war may be argued to have been a divisive body with charles failing to develop a clear approach from this
 failure to adapt may also be considered with his attempts to maintain ordinary administration of government contrasting with implementation of new forms of taxation and the introduction of the new model army
 such issues may be explored with reference to a range of events battles and candidates may take varied approaches to examining the issue of strategic failures although the focus should be clearly on the question
 at level there will be a focused evaluation of the relative significance of the different factors with broad and full treatment
 at the lower levels expect a narrative of the civil wars which whilst it may be detailed will be largely implicit
 protest crisis and rebellion in england question number indicative content mark this question clearly focuses upon the extent to which henry was threatened by the pilgrimage of grace and the three sources offer differing perspectives
 source suggests that the pilgrims were a threat arguing that in the early stages of the rebellion much of the north was beyond the control of the crown
 the emphasis is placed on the relative inferiority of the crown in military terms also highlighting a willingness to use war on the part of the rebels
 source can be used to argue that the threat was limited emphasising their conservative nature opposing religious change but being disinclined to challenge the king with violence
 in drawing on their own knowledge candidates may examine a range of issues such as the loyalty of the nobility and reliance upon the likes of norfolk to put down the rebellion
 whilst candidates may offer extensive knowledge of the differing stages of the event of late and the varying make up of those involved the focus should remain firmly on assessing the level of threat
 responses at level will apply knowledge to offer a judgement on the relative strengths of the differing views and to resolve the conflicts and offer an alternative hypothesis that successfully combines elements from different standpoints

 level level demonstrate understanding of the past through explanation analysis and arriving at substantiated judgements key concepts such as causation consequence continuity change and significance within an historical the relationships between key features and characteristics of the periods studied
 source evaluation is reasonably full and appropriate but lacks completeness on the issues raised by the sources in the light of the question
 june provides a comparison but there is unevenness confining the comparison to the second half of the answer or simply to a concluding paragraph
 source evaluation is partial and it is likely that the provenance itself is not compared may be undeveloped or merely commented on discretely
 identifies some comparative points but is very sequential and perhaps implicit comment on the sources is basic general undeveloped or juxtaposed often through poorly understood quotation

 is aware of some of the limitations of the sources individually or as a group but mostly uses them for reference and to illustrate an argument rather than analysing and evaluating them as evidence
 question mark scheme answer the context is the great reform act a measure long pursued and desired by radicals with much popular unrest during its prolonged passage in both agree that the act is harmful to the radical cause
 hetherington in considers it a measure to keep the people down whilst hunt in thinks the people have been rendered outlaws because of their lack of property
 both are confident that it will fail the spirit of in the in the differences are that hetherington in focuses on government motives arguing that they had intended such an outcome all along
 it was an measure designed to split the middle classes from any dalliance with radicals and align them firmly with the landowning aristocracy to preserve the old system
 it is about and hunt in looks to the future arguing that it will force the people to take responsibility for their own fate especially on wages and hours
 his analysis of is a political and class one the oligarchic whigs needed to attract new urban property to strengthen their hold over the political system
 the middle classes were to be included to prevent them joining with the other victims of aristocratic monopoly the labouring and working classes
 although he talks in economic class terms hetherington in also has a strongly political analysis of a situation which will lead six years later to the charter strength will come in numbers and in the concession of universal suffrage
 hunt in is similarly entirely political talking of the continued unenfranchised as although mentioning economic reform and action it is subservient to political action and is a consequence of neglecting a proper representation in parliament
 both he and hetherington take a strongly political line and as the key representatives of radical leadership in the first years of the century their evidence is telling
 stephens in also contains traditional references to political liberty free air security although its context and language is economic religious and social
 he stresses the importance of political as radical leaders all three may be considered effective evidence for the political origins of chartism
 successful answers will need to make use of all five sources testing them against contextual knowledge and evaluating their strengths and weaknesses including any limitations as evidence
 the sources can be read analysed in different ways and as part of their judgement candidates will need to appreciate this
 to kydd the new poor law and the law league he does not are what has really aroused class hatred and fed into chartism
 writing in the year of the his evidence of the strength of social feeling generated by opposition to such class legislation as the new poor law could be considered convincing
 he became an active chartist and stephens in makes the classic statement about chartism being a social and economic question and although his audience may condition this response
 he stresses clothing food housing and work as the crucial recruiter and is publically saying this to his audience on the manchester moors
 there is also an indirect reference to the new poor law in the security of family wife and children separated in the new to which he appeals
 candidates may use contextual knowledge on the great victorian depression which affected chartism and may have acted as the key recruiting sergeant as well as affecting how leaders like pilling framed their appeals
 hunt in source also stresses the need to take economic action over wages and work although its overall june marks guidance question mark scheme answer context remains a political one
 candidates may decide that the evidence of and is more convincing given that these sources were from more ordinary chartists albeit active ones
 kydd and pilling despite active involvement locally and some leadership roles were of humble origin the former a glasgow shoemaker the latter a power loom weaver
 the charter was after all exclusively political in its demands albeit with economic and social transformation as a rationale for their political demands
 both sources stress the main matters in dispute that shares had been purchased and no votes in the affairs of the canal company were attached to this ownership
 however there are considerable differences which outweigh the similarities especially given the political controversies generated and by the nature of the authors the main protagonist disraeli and a rigorous liberal and former chancellor robert lowe
 they differ in their approach to the issue of whether the british government had in fact gained much practical control over the canal
 lowe in argues that shares without votes were effectively useless and would not prevent a future french or russian monopoly
 instead he changes the goalposts by claiming the purchase was more about a wider imperial vision safer that would secure the key imperial highway to india and the far east
 he fails to answer the specifics of accusations by denying that it was intended as a it is on this vision that the real differences lie
 lowe in whilst agreeing with disraeli that the purchase was seen as a imperial policy considers it spurious expensive and more about misleading the public gaining votes and selling newspapers
 candidates may also note that that there is no mention of the rothschild bank in june marks guidance comparison of two sources
 he is aware he has to seek retrospective approval for the purchase given the cost involved but is confident his action is popular
 in contrast lowe a rather battered gladstonian former chancellor was usually a details man his points are in part narrowly fiscal but he also makes the wider point about the politics of manoeuvre which he is keen to expose
 together they provide the two sides of the argument and agree on enough imperial to demonstrate the importance of the purchase both politically and in terms of future imperial developments
 successful answers will need to make use of all five sources testing them against contextual knowledge and evaluating their strengths and weaknesses any limitations as evidence
 question mark scheme answer with lowe stressing later events in egypt where governments reacted rather inconsistently to events and disraelian and over dramatisation of the extent of his success or consider his comments to be sour grapes
 however his views are partly supported by evidence in other imperial spheres in sources and in source disraeli is clearly exasperated at government policy being led in effect by an viceroy of india
 he clearly acted on his own initiative ignoring more careful moves by disraeli and the new foreign secretary lord salisbury to square the russians and limit their feared diplomatic penetration of afghanistan
 salisbury was right that lytton wanted a afghan policy based on insisting the amir receive a british mission in kabul to warn off the russians and was also right that it would lead to disaster
 suggestion of token force a such action not intended to be was rejected by his india secretary as half military response was eventually agreed upon
 candidates may know that hicks confidence was the zulus united and the boers later policy had failed and he and the colonial secretary could only watch helplessly
 candidates could stress this as the key imperial interest for almost a century and was rightly perceived as such by disraeli
 the transvaal had been annexed in despite earlier reservations hicks beach now supports the zulu war and thinks the situation on the ground conducive to a successful conclusion to british consolidation in southern africa
 candidates can either accept this as a reasonable conclusion to draw in january and stress a positive and forceful african policy or use their knowledge of events before and after january to argue for weak imperial policy
 candidates may conclude that the sources stress a strong policy given their conservative and governmental provenance for lowe in but knowledge and the private fears and divisions of sources and may suggest a weak reactive policy
 june marks guidance question mark scheme answer both sources convey a sense of hostility that was shared by most members of the house of lords
 argues that have no right to jeopardise these in any way whilst warns against doing anything cannot but serve the purpose of destroying its power for both view reform as a threat to tradition
 this is clearly for more overtly selfish reasons as introduction of peers would mean the degradation of this the new appointments would be liberals
 in evaluating the sources candidates may explain the reluctance of both the duke and the lord to accept new peers as typical of men whose titles were hereditary and who preferred to protect that privilege
 northumberland was speaking when the second parliament bill was before the house of commons entered the lords in when still hoped its passage might be thwarted and could be seen as an attempt to influence opinion
 on the other hand was delivered during the debate in the lords itself and at a point when the king had made it clear that he june marks guidance comparison of two sources
 others may prefer curzon in on the grounds that he was an active politician administrator and aristocrat former viceroy of whilst northumberland represented only the ancient nobility of the north
 candidates may evaluate as typical of a liberal who was angry with the lords for rejecting the budget which he helped shape and to dismiss any sense of revenge on the lords he and the cabinet may have harboured
 northumberland in sees the liberals as motivated by the principle of class and by a drive against landed property embraced by both old and new liberals
 says second chamber has frustrated our efforts to legislate on many and the earlier reference to the finance bill could be used as an example of judgement in context based on the set of sources and own knowledge
 successful answers will need to make use of all five sources testing them against contextual knowledge and evaluating their strengths and weaknesses any limitations as evidence
 candidates may add knowledge about how various liberal plans such as the education bill and the licensing bill had been thwarted by the lords
 it was certainly the case that home rule proposals were not at the centre of the elections of which explains the remark that they hidden from the at the time of his speech the issue had become central
 admits that the lords stood out twice against his over the budget and the parliament bill even if had been candidates should recognise this as a reference to the finance bill and the first parliament bill
 in warning the lords not to anything which cannot but serve the purpose of the liberals in destroying its power for the author of implies that this would be to the advantage of the liberals
 indeed the significance of the earlier reference to the of could be examined to explain how new peers once appointed would be permanent and so give the liberals control of the upper house
 may have been as concerned about its implications but his remarks were made during the debate when he was trying to adopt a practical position
 there was a case here in that the liberals had lost their overall majority in the two elections and thus in part their mandate to do certain things
 views on what reason was most important may be offered but candidates have the chance at least to demonstrate that motives varied
 in may things had moved roosevelt had died and the incoming president was more russian forces had moved further into eastern europe
 the interpretation of free and fair elections agreed on in yalta in february had not been the same for stalin as for the western leaders and it was clear that there would be russian domination of eastern europe
 his conceding in of influence in romania and bulgaria accords with his recognition of russian strength as seen in both were of less importance to eastern mediterranean concerns
 might be typical of need to maintain the russian war effort maintaining good relations with stalin as a diplomatic and military necessity and to protect british interests with very little to back any agreement up
 marks guidance all the sources but especially of and may be seen to support a realistic policy towards the bearing in mind the need to continue the wartime alliance and weak position within it
 realism is shown in most strongly in the anxiety about russian influence in the acknowledging that stalin did keep his word in greece but was using techniques to take control and had considerable military capacity
 the reference to of yalta might be lack of realism or might be a realistic way of not admitting to the new president that allies were unrealistic in order to keep his support
 could also be seen as with ideological differences and public opinion being put aside to get spheres of influence and to protect british interests in the eastern mediterranean
 it was not without success as stalin did not interfere in greece yugoslavia eventually became neutral in the communist world while bulgaria and rumania became soviet satellites as envisaged in the agreement
 it was also somewhat unrealistic perhaps for churchill to pursue this sort of personal diplomacy regardless of the and regardless of previous events as he admits in and the historian in points out
 successful answers will need to make use of all five sources testing them against contextual evidence and evaluating their strengths and weaknesses any limitations as evidence
 of course this view may be seen as unrealistic in itself trying to maintain former strategic and imperial position
 may be seen as too idealistic a view contrary to the type of realistic policy churchill was forced to follow at yalta
 on the other hand churchill may have been unrealistic to think that he would escape censure from some in his party about what seemed like appeasement of stalin
 however whether the sort of personal appeal for good relations and some accommodation with the democratic poles was particularly realistic given the situation set out by may be questioned
 on the other hand churchill still needed russian support in the war and armies had not been decisively beaten so perhaps appeals of friendship were realistic in context
 that to truman is much more realistic although its purpose is to bring the on side in the coming era when the soviets threatened to dominate europe
 the historical view in of an unrealistic churchill omits much of the above as june marks guidance question mark scheme answer well as the context of continuing mediterranean strategic and imperial concerns

 the marking schemes which follow were those used by for the summer examination in they were finalised after detailed discussion at conferences by all the examiners involved in the assessment
 the conferences were held shortly after the papers were taken so that reference could be made to the full range of responses with photocopied scripts forming the basis of discussion
 the aim of the conferences was to ensure that the marking schemes were interpreted and applied in the same way by all examiners

 registered company number with its registered office at edinburgh gate harlow essex extract adapted from mcloughlin v all the husband and three children were involved in a road accident caused by the negligence of the defendants
 held the test of liability for damages for nervous shock was reasonable foreseeability of the plaintiff being injured by nervous shock as a result of the negligence
 scenes from the ground were broadcast live on television from time to time during the course of the disaster and were broadcast later on television as news items
 ten of the plaintiffs appealed to the house of lords contending that the only test for establishing liability for psychiatric illness was whether such illness was reasonably foreseeable
 about three hours after the accident mr page experienced symptoms of a nature that indicated that his condition was resurfacing and at the time of the trial he was regarded as a permanent invalid
 the main issue for consideration by the house of lords was whether it was foreseeable that someone in his position would suffer psychiatric injury
 related to this was the question as to whether the plaintiff was a person of normal fortitude and whether that is relevant to the foreseeability point
 in other words although physical injury was foreseeable even though in the event it did not occur it had to be decided whether foreseeability of psychiatric injury was a separate requirement
 the majority of the house of lords held that as mr page was a primary victim the two types of injury did not have to be considered separately
 lords keith and jauncey dissented on the basis that under the circumstances it was unforeseeable that the plaintiff would suffer injury by shock
 he said that although foreseeability of physical injury is not necessary in nervous shock cases in certain circumstances secondary victims can it is sufficient
 it is admitted by the chief constable that the events were caused by the negligence of the police in allowing the overcrowding of two spectator pens
 in an ideal world all those who have suffered as a result of the negligence ought to be compensated
 but we do not live in we live in a practical world where the tort system imposes limits to the classes of claims that rank for consideration as well as to the heads of recoverable damages
 this results of course in imperfect justice but it is by and large the best that the common law can do
 counsel for the appellant is invoking the concept of a rescuer as an exception to the limitations recognized by the house of lords in alcock and page v smith
 the specific difficulty counsel faces is that it is common ground that none of the four police officers were at any time exposed to personal danger and none thought that they were so exposed
 he sought comfort in the general observations in alcock of lord oliver about the category of see none of the other law lords in alcock discussed this category
 moreover the issue of rescuers entitlement to recover for psychiatric harm was not before the house on that occasion and lord oliver was not considering the competing arguments presently before the house
 english decision in support of argument chadwick v british railways board mr chadwick had entered a wrecked railway carriage to help and work among the injured
 on the findings the rescuer had passed the threshold of being in personal danger but his psychiatric injury was caused by full horror of his when he was presumably not always in personal danger
 but it is not authority for the proposition that a person who never exposed himself to any personal danger and never thought that he was in personal danger can recover pure psychiatric injury as a rescuer
 without such limitation one would have the unedifying spectacle that while bereaved relatives are not allowed to recover as in alcock ghoulishly curious spectators who assisted in some peripheral way in the aftermath of a disaster might recover
 turn over my lords the law on the recovery of compensation for pure psychiatric harm is a patchwork quilt of distinctions which are difficult to justify
 in reality there are no refined analytical tools which will enable the courts to draw lines by way of compromise solution in a way which is coherent and morally defensible
 pp hambrook king v phillips having set out the parameters of nervous shock liability the law was reasonably well settled through the years
 once again the floodgates threatened to open and just as the house subsequently acted to restrict liability for purely economic loss so it acted to restrict liability for nervous shock
 understandably the decision in alcock attracted the obvious criticism that the lines of liability were drawn in an arbitrary and unduly restrictive way turn over extract adapted from facing the consequences understanding tort law
 the problems posed by nervous shock a term redolent of victorian feminine weakness and suggesting a certain scepticism about its very existence owe much to tort historical origins which it has found difficulty in discarding
 the reasons why nervous shock poses problems for tort law are epitomised in the early case of bourhill v young young woman alighting from a bus witnessed a gory traffic accident
 in other words there is a triangular relationship between duty of care remoteness and causation making nervous shock a general problem for tort law rather than merely a problem of duty
 like economic loss the concept of psychiatric injury introduces the spectre of liability to indeterminate class of persons for indeterminate this is a problem of remoteness of damage rather than duty

 examiners should also be prepared to award zero marks if the response is not worthy of credit according to the mark scheme
 where some judgement is required mark schemes will provide the principles by which marks will be awarded and exemplification may be limited
 when examiners are in doubt regarding the application of the mark scheme to a response the team leader must be consulted
 history marking guidance marking of levels of response the mark scheme provides an indication of the sorts of answer that might be found at different levels
 it is intended as a guide and it will be necessary therefore for examiners to use their professional judgement in deciding both at which level a question has been answered and how effectively points have been sustained
 candidates should always be rewarded according to the quality of thought expressed in their answer and not solely according to the amount of knowledge conveyed
 however candidates with only a superficial knowledge will be unable to develop or sustain points sufficiently to move to higher levels
 at the end of each answer examiners should look back on the answer as a whole in the light of these general criteria in order to ensure that the total mark reflects their overall impression of the worth
 deciding on the mark point within a level the first stage is to decide the overall level and then whether the work represents high mid or low performance within the level
 one stronger passage at level would not by itself merit a level award but it would be evidence to support a high level award unless there were also substantial weaknesses in other areas
 assessing quality of written communication qowc will have a bearing if the qowc is inconsistent with the communication descriptor for the level in which the answer falls
 if for example a history response displays mid level criteria but fits the level qowc descriptors it will require a move down within the level
 generic level descriptors section and the essay questions in part will have an analytical focus requiring candidates to reach a substantiated judgement on a historical issue or problem
 the statements will be supported by factual material which has some accuracy and relevance although not directed at the focus of the question
 low level marks the qualities of level are displayed but material is less convincing in its and the quality of written communication does not conform
 mid level marks the qualities of level are displayed but material is less convincing in its or the quality of written communication does not conform
 the writing will show elements of coherence but there are likely to be passages which lack clarity proper organisation
 low level marks the qualities of level are displayed but material is less convincing in its and the quality of written communication does not conform
 mid level marks the qualities of level are displayed but material is less convincing in its or the quality of written communication does not conform
 they may however include material which is either descriptive and thus only implicitly relevant to the focus or which strays from that focus in places
 the candidate will demonstrate some of the skills needed to produce a convincing essay but there may be passages which show deficiencies in organisation
 low level marks the qualities of level are displayed but material is less convincing in its and the quality of written communication does not conform
 mid level marks the qualities of level are displayed but material is less convincing in its or the quality of written communication does not conform
 candidates offer an analytical response which relates well to the focus of the question and which shows some understanding of the key issues contained in it with some evaluation of argument
 low level marks the qualities of level are displayed but material is less convincing in its and the quality of written communication does not conform
 mid level marks the qualities of level are displayed but material is less convincing in its or the quality of written communication does not conform
 occasional syntactical spelling errors may be found but they will not impede coherent deployment of the material and argument
 low level marks the qualities of level are displayed but material is less convincing in its and the quality of written communication does conform
 mid level marks the qualities of level are displayed but material is less convincing in its or the quality of written communication does not conform
 thus most candidates whose historical understanding related to a given question suggests that they should sit in a particular level will express that understanding in ways which broadly conform to the communication descriptor appropriate to that level
 indicators of written communication are best considered normatively and may be used to help decide a specific mark to be awarded within a level
 quality of written communication which fails to conform to the descriptor for the level will depress the award of marks by a within the level
 and level mark descriptor candidates will produce a series of statements some of which may be simplified on the basis of factual material which has some accuracy and relevance although not directed at the focus of the question
 low level mark the qualities of level are displayed but material is less convincing in its and the quality of written communication does not conform
 mid level marks the qualities of level are displayed but material is less convincing in its or the quality of written communication does not conform

 candidates offer an analytical response from their own knowledge which supports analysis of presented source material and which attempts integration with it
 the selected material will address the focus of the question and show some understanding of the key issues contained in it with some evaluation of argument and as appropriate interpretation
 the analysis will be supported by accurate factual material which will be mostly relevant to the question asked although the selection of material may lack balance in places
 low level marks the qualities of level are displayed but material is less convincing in its and the quality of written communication does not conform
 mid level marks the qualities of level are displayed but material is less convincing in its or the quality of written communication does not conform
 candidates offer a sustained analysis from their own knowledge which both supports and is integrated with analysis of the source material
 occasional syntactical spelling errors may be found but they will not impede coherent deployment of the material and argument
 low level marks the qualities of level are displayed but material convincing in its and the quality of communication does not conform
 mid level marks the qualities of level are displayed but material convincing in its or the quality of communication does not conform
 thus most candidates whose historical understanding related to a given question suggests that they should sit in a particular level will express that understanding in ways which broadly conform to the communication descriptor appropriate to that level
 indicators of written communication are best considered normatively and may be used to help decide a specific mark to be awarded within a level
 quality of written communication which fails to conform to the descriptor for the level will depress the award of marks by a subband within the level

 the world in crisis question number indicative content mark source provides support for the statement in the question by maintaining that the league was associated with defeat and disillusionment
 it contends that the incorporation of the covenant into the treaty of versailles and the denial of membership to the defeated states brought about the failure of the league
 candidates might link the latter with the argument developed in source source notes how the initial idealism surrounding the league foundered on hard political realities particularly and soviet and the aggression of the revisionist states
 at level a clear conclusion about reasons for the failure linked to an understanding of the association with defeat and disillusionment will be offered and the sources will be used with some confidence
 at level there should be at least some attempt to discuss the relative importance of defeat and disillusionment in the failure of the league
 at level candidates will present a reasoned judgement about the importance of defeat and disillusionment in explaining league weaknesses and the answer will be informed by precisely selected evidence from both sources and own knowledge
 number indicative content mark source gives candidates material to support the view that the outbreak of war in europe in was due to ideological differences between the western liberal democracies and nazi germany
 here candidates can use their own knowledge to extend the analysis by examining the outbreak of the war from a more international perspective
 source examines how britain and france did little to restrain hitler before and how nazi germany exploited the versailles treaty to increase its power in europe prior to war
 level answers will reach a conclusion probably recognising that the argument is not all about ideological differences and clearly recognising that the sources give different interpretations
 at level candidates will sustain their argument about the relative importance of ideological differences on the basis of precisely selected evidence both sources and own leading to an overall judgement
 stronger candidates may pick up on the reference to rigidity and confrontational and offer relevant own knowledge to support or challenge this view
 according to this extract important influences within the soviet union and the as the soviet search for security and the sense of its own made superpower confrontation inevitable
 at level there should be at least some attempt to discuss the relative strength of the arguments on the basis of confident use of the presented sources and good understanding of the issues under debate
 at level candidates will sustain their argument about the relative importance of errors on the basis of precisely selected evidence from both sources and own knowledge leading to an overall judgement
 number indicative content mark source supports the statement in the question by suggesting that during the the soviet bloc faced major economic problems and was technologically far behind the west
 most of the satellite states had accumulated large debts and the was to meet the demands of the this view is partly endorsed by source which maintains that policies the deployment of superior effectively ended the cold war
 at level a clear conclusion on why the cold war came to an end will be reached and the sources will be used with some confidence
 at level candidates will offer a sustained discussion of the relative importance of key factors with some concentration on soviet economic and technological inferiority
 in your answers to questions you are therefore encouraged to draw upon aspects of social inequality and difference studied throughout your course
 answer questions and and either questions and or questions and investigating change at work mccabe wanted to investigate change in the workplace and explore how power affected relationships between management and workers
 he conducted a case study into employment at a major bank which was trying to reduce the number of people employed and cut costs
 however mccabe also noticed that there was little resistance to the increased pressure and poorer working conditions even though many were very unhappy
 mccabe wanted to explore the reasons why these employees accepted these changes and tolerated conditions that made their working conditions much worse
 questions were for example are the main changes you have seen in the and is it like to work the interviews were tape recorded and analysed afterwards to identify common themes and issues
 the case study also involved content analysis of secondary data such as documents produced by the bank and their employees during the introduction of the changes and new working conditions
 mccabe found that employees came to accept these changes because they needed a job to earn a living and do anything about the situation
 one employee said about the changes got to be take it or leave it if you want to stay that is what is expected of this reflected the inequalities of power in workplace relationships
 mccabe found that acceptance was also due to the way that work may provide employees with a sense of shared purpose and identity
 by working hard within teams they thought that they could help one another to enjoy success and gain financial reward for themselves and the bank as an organisation
 this attitude encouraged the employees to accept the changes being introduced and act as willing workers even though it may not have been in their own interests
 outline and assess the view that case studies are the best way to research the attitudes of employees to change in the workplace
 using your wider sociological knowledge answer either questions and or questions and outline the evidence that young people experience inequality in the contemporary outline and assess the contributions sociologists have made to explain age inequality
 outline the evidence that some social classes are privileged in the contemporary outline and assess sociological explanations of the changing class structure
